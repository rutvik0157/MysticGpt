            "['One should continuously engage in delivering and listening to talks on the glory of God and his Sadhu. Maharaj has come here (to earth) with his Akshardham, pƒÅrshads and all his powers. He is exactly the same (today).1 He whom we wish to attain after death, we have attained during this life; there is nothing more left to attain. If this truth is not understood properly, the jiva remains weak. Once this is understood, the jiva will no longer consider itself weak and will acquire a different mettle. Also, there is no greater endeavour than to understand the glory of God. Without understanding the glory, even countless other endeavours will not enable the jiva to attain spiritual strength. The means to understanding this glory is profound association with such a holy Sadhu, and without it the true glory of God cannot be understood.', '1. Meaning, the human form on earth is the same as the divine form in Akshardham.', 'Without learning the teachings of SƒÅnkhya,1 faults such as greed, lust, taste, attachment and ego, and the three miseries ‚Äì due to adhyƒÅtma, adhibhut and adhidaiv2 ‚Äì cannot be removed. Without SƒÅnkhya, satsang is said to be only half complete. Thus, to remain happy learn the principles of SƒÅnkhya.', '1. SƒÅnkhya ‚Äì to realize that the body, the world and all worldly pleasures are perishable. And to believe the ƒÅtmƒÅ and ParamƒÅtmƒÅ to be permanent and focus the mind on it.', '2. AdhyƒÅtma ‚Äì miseries of the mind. Adhibhut ‚Äì physical illnesses, miseries. Adhidaiv ‚Äì floods, famines, earthquakes, plagues and other natural disasters.', 'Prahladji fought for many days with Narayan, but God was not won over. Then God told Prahlad, ‚ÄúI cannot be won over by such wars. The way to win me over is by singing my bhajans, thinking of me in your mind and cherishing my murti in your eyes. In this way, always remember me.‚Äù Then, Prahlad tried this method and God was won over within six months. Thus, to please God, learn this method, which is the best.', 'If one has from within (essentially and earnestly) understood the glory of God, then whatever difficult circumstances1 arise or whatever ill health arises, one still believes, ‚ÄúWithout God‚Äôs wish nobody can move even a leaf.‚Äù With this understanding, one remains happy. And if one does not understand this and encounters difficult circumstances, then his satsang will be spoiled.', '1. The eight factors of place, time, action, company, mantra, holy scriptures, initiation and meditation may be adverse and troublesome.', 'What spiritual endeavours will this jiva undertake? Attaining moksha through spiritual means can be likened to farming with the aid of bullocks and a labourer to irrigate the field by drawing water from a well. It requires a great deal of effort. The little crop that is raised is eaten by cattle and birds. Attaining moksha through the grace of God is like raising a crop when the rainfall is plentiful. Then, even if the cattle and birds eat it or thieves steal it, the crop will never get exhausted. Wells, lakes and rivers may dry, but not oceans. Similarly, liberation through God is like that.

Similarly, there are many types of good food, good clothes and many other such sense pleasures. But, the attachment to inferior objects is not as much as for superior objects. However, as long as this jiva has desires to enjoy superior objects and is deficient in spiritual wisdom, this knowledge is not understood.

There are two ways to understands this short statement by Swami: (1) In the beginning, Shriji Maharaj made the paramhansas perform extreme austerities by issuing various prakarans. In one prakaran, Maharaj made the paramhansas abstain from eating foods that contained six types of tastes. This was known as the khatras vartamƒÅn. Many sadhus passed this harsh vartamƒÅn. Maharaj then overturned this prakaran and started serving delicious foods and sweets. However, many sadhus, who were inclined toward practicing vairƒÅgya, did not prefer this freedom from austerities. So, many of these sadhus left. (2) Another way to interpret this statement is: It is possible to stay in Satsang when a harsh prakaran like khatras is observed, but when one is allowed to eat delicious foods like jalebis, one will certainly fall, because indulging in the best of the vishays will awaken the indriyas‚Äô inclination to enjoy the vishays. This leads one to fall from observing the niyams of satsang.', 'See Swamini Vat 2/154 footnote for the list of prakarans issued by Shriji Maharaj.', '2. The sadguru sadhus explain the significant of this statement this way: When Maharaj made the sadhus perform extreme austerities, the inclination of their indriyas became dormant. When he ended the khatras vartamƒÅn and started feeding the sadhus, their indriyas awakened and became attached to the delicious foods. This lead to thoughts of enjoying other aspects of the world and they left. In contrast, the ones who derived happiness only from Maharaj‚Äôs murti successfully passed this prakaran. Here, Swami refers to frost as ‚Äòcold heat‚Äô. This is in reference to Vachanamrut Gadhada II-23: Heat and Frost.', 'Maharaj used to say, ‚ÄúDevotees do not become happy in any way; if we give them money then they do not become free to come for darshan and if we keep them poor, they say, ‚ÄòWe do not get food, so why go for darshan?‚Äô Thus, both ways, the jiva does not worship God. For this, we use four remedies: sƒÅm ‚Äì we talk; dƒÅm ‚Äì give them God; bhed ‚Äì explain everything as perishable; and dand ‚Äì show them the miseries of hell. This is what we do.‚Äù', 'In Satsang, some are liberated souls. Even among them, there are some differences. Some are capable of constructing mandirs, buildings and resthouses for pilgrims; some can manage fields, farms and gardens; some can raise and manage funds; and some are able to manage estate and property. There are many liberated souls like these, but there are only a few liberated souls who promote talks on the three topics of upƒÅsanƒÅ, God‚Äôs commands and spiritual knowledge. And value lies only in these three talks. Also, dharma and detachment are included in them. So, by keeping these three talks in the forefront, other things are also easily achieved. However, only a few liberated souls propagate them. But only they contain the real substance. After repeatedly thinking about this, I have developed firm conviction in it and spoken.', 'If one has attached one‚Äôs jiva to the great Sadhu, and due to adverse time and place it becomes necessary to leave satsang, then still the great Sadhu will himself observe any atonement or will give the devotee the strength to observe the atonement.

Whereas that which another makes one do accumulates in one‚Äôs heart, and when one is free, one still thinks of it (the task). So, within, there is confusion. While one does some tasks everyone shows much affection, but if unknowingly something wrong is done, then the blame is put on one‚Äôs head.

If they gained weight, the farmers would be punished. Despite their best efforts the farmers could not prevent the goats from gaining weight and so they were punished. They went to Birbal for help. After assessing the situation, Birbal fed the goats and then took them to a ferocious lion which was in a cage. The frightening roar of the lion caused diarrhoea in the goats. So whatever they had eaten was passed out. In this way, the goats were fully fed everyday and then brought before the lion and their weight did not increase.

So, for us, there is no alternative but to do that way. Also, even if one is an ƒÅchƒÅrya, a son of God, an ishwar or some small or big deity, still there is no release without behaving in that way.

First, Maharaj‚Äôs upƒÅsanƒÅ; second, Maharaj‚Äôs commands; third, attachment with the great God-realized Sadhu; and fourth, friendship with the devotees. These four principles are the life-force of the jiva and they should never be given up. However, if inauspicious place, time, company, actions, scriptures, mantra, initiation and deities are encountered, they will make one believe Maharaj and other avatƒÅrs as equal, show spiritual commands to be unimportant, equate the great Sadhu with one who is lax in Satsang, and attribute faults to the devout.

That is an example and its message is that this entire Satsang is the body of Maharaj, but Maharaj eternally resides through the manifest human form of the God-realized Sadhu. When one attaches to him, one gets the bliss of Maharaj. Just as the joy of drinking milk is obtained from the cow‚Äôs udder.‚Äù', 'Type:  Keyword  Exact']\n",

There, some bulls had arrived. So, wherever the calf attempted to place its mouth, it received a kick. As a result of these kicks, its mouth became swollen, but it did not get the pleasure of drinking milk. Then, even when its own mother came, it was not able to suck. Similarly, leaving this Sadhu and seeking happiness elsewhere is like receiving kicks. Since, when one lapses in observing God‚Äôs commands and understanding his true form, one will not be able to sit with such a Sadhu ‚Äì just as the calf could not go to the mother.‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúWhen I talk like this for two months then once again your jiva will join with God as before. That is how much deficiency has set in. And these talks are for uniting with God.‚Äù', '1. Shivlal Sheth of Botad was a very wealthy and respected businessman. He was an ardent disciple of Gunatitanand Swami. He sponsored the murti-pratishtha celebrations of Shri Harikrishna Maharaj at Gadhada mandir. However, due to the company of some sadhus and devotees envious of Gunatitanand Swami, Shivlal‚Äôs devotion towards him suffered a little setback. Realizing this, Gunatitanand Swami talked to him.', 'One day Swami asked Shivlal Sheth of Botad, ‚ÄúWhere did you go today?‚Äù Shivlal replied with folded hands, ‚ÄúToday, I went to the city.‚Äù Then he added, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve sponsored a meal.‚Äù Swami enquired, ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Then Shivlal said, ‚ÄúI bought some gold from one place and sold it at another place ‚Äì from this I earned a profit of 150 rupees. I sponsored the meal with that amount.‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúIt is proper that you thought of trading in gold. But have you ever thought of taking 1000 million kilos of agricultural waste and making some money?‚Äù Then he said, ‚ÄúNo, Maharaj.‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúAccording to the understanding of the great Sadhu, except for the murti of Maharaj, everything upto Prakruti-Purush is just waste and is of no value. By leaving the darshan and discourses of such a Sadhu, what have you earned?‚Äù Saying this, Swami destroyed the intellectual ego (of Shivlal).', 'One devotee asked, ‚ÄúHow should we understand the statement ‚ÄòAkshardham in the midst of Golok‚Äô which is written in the scriptures of the Sampraday?‚Äù1 Swami answered, ‚ÄúEveryone believes the location of Akshardham as according to their understanding. Many believe Akshardham is Badrikashram. Many believe Akshardham is Shvetdwip. Many believe Akshardham is Vaikunth. Many believe Akshardham is Golok. However, whoever understands the greatness of Maharaj understands Akshardham as it is (thoroughly).‚Äù', 'Then, Swami had Vachanamrut Gadhada I-63 read and said, ‚ÄúLook! Maharaj has said, an ant appears larger amidst mosquitoes. A scorpion is larger amidst ants. A snake is larger amidst scorpions. A kite is larger amidst snakes. A bull is larger amidst kites. An elephant is larger amidst bulls. A mountain like Mount Girnar is larger amidst elephants. Mount Meru is larger amidst Mount Girnar. Mount Lokalok is larger amidst Mount Meru. Similarly, one should understand Akshardham amidst Golok. But one should not understand this as Mount Girnar existing within an elephant.2 And Girnar is considered [the largest] among infinite other mountains. Similarly, Meru is considered [the largest] among infinite other mountains. And Lokalok is considered [the largest] among infinite other mountains. Similarly, Akshardham is considered the [largest] among infinite other abodes. However, one should not understand Akshardham is included within Golok. And other abodes are described as having limits, but it is not mentioned that Akshardham has a limit. This is the principle.‚Äù', '1. This statement is found in Vachanamrut Vartal 18 and in the Paratharo of the Vachanamrut.', '2. With this analogy of an elephant and Girnar, Swami explains that ‚ÄòAkshardham in the midst of Golok‚Äô should be interpreted as Akshardham being greater (in terms of size, divinity, etc.) compared to many Goloks instead of Akshardham existing within Golok.', '‚ÄúWith whatever commands I give, I give Maharaj‚Äôs murti. But those who do not have spiritual wisdom do not understand this point. Maharaj and the great Sadhu have only one principle ‚Äì that Maharaj wants to give the bliss of his own murti, but not the joy of powers. Since, otherwise, the jiva continually desires powers. In the same way, the great Sadhu is of the opinion that jivas should be united with the murti of Maharaj, but not be attached to worldly pleasures or the body. One who joins them to worldly pleasures is not a God-realized Sadhu and one who joins them to powers is not Bhagwan Purushottam. This principle was well understood by Prahlad ‚Äì that one who gives worldly pleasures is not God and one who asks for worldly pleasures is not a devotee. Therefore, one who wants to be truly faithful to God should not desire for anything except the murti of God. That is the principle.‚Äù Saying this, Swami said, ‚ÄúEven the yogic powers are not able to assume the form of this God and this Sadhu, since they are not comprehensible. However, the forms of other avatƒÅrs are assumed by yogic powers, but yogic powers are not able to assume the form of this manifest Maharaj and this manifest Sadhu. Just as an actor cannot impersonate a ruling king.‚Äù', 'To understand the innermost principles of Maharaj and the great Sadhu is very difficult. When can they be known? When one serves such great sadhus as Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami and Krupanand Swami for many years, then one comes to know them. But without this, they cannot be known; that is a fundamental fact. And without that, whatever we come to know is due to the grace of Shriji Maharaj and this great Sadhu. And when is this grace earned? When one is firm in dharma, has very firm knowledge of ƒÅtmƒÅ and Paramatma, has intense detachment from the sense pleasures and has single-minded devotion to Bhagwan Purushottam, coupled with knowledge of his glory. Such a person earns grace, but one who is body-conscious does not earn grace. Without the above, what appears to be grace will not last. Of that there is no doubt.', '‚ÄúIt is very difficult to know satsang as it is, and even if somebody knows, it is not practised. If somebody does practise satsang then it is not practised as it should be. And if it is practised as it should, then it is difficult to maintain it ‚Äì either he goes out of control or becomes mad, but is unable to maintain it. So, who can maintain this satsang? Only one who has knowledge of the glory of Maharaj and the great Sadhu, coupled with intense love for them. Others are just not able to maintain it.‚Äù', 'Then he said, ‚ÄúToday, those who have taken birth in human form have one foot in Akshardham and those who have recognized this Sadhu have both feet in Akshardham. But, those who do not have knowledge of these talks will not understand them.', '‚ÄúIn this Satsang there are countless people who are like Prahlad, Ambrish and Parvatbhai. But without close association with a sadhu, they cannot attain spiritual knowledge; and without spiritual knowledge, the glory of God and his holy Sadhu is not known, and without knowing the glory one cannot become happy. There is no doubt about it.‚Äù', 'If true spiritual knowledge is attained, then one is not trapped in the net of mƒÅyƒÅ. Just as water cannot wet a waterfowl, similarly, if such a person encounters mƒÅyƒÅ, it is unable to taint him. And just as a swordfish cannot be confined to a net because it has sharp edges on both sides ‚Äì so it cuts the net and gets out ‚Äì similarly, such a powerful person frees countless jivas from mƒÅyƒÅ. You have the target of spreading satsang throughout this earth. What is that? You have the great fortune that the manifest form of Maharaj and the manifest form of the Sadhu are present. (They will inspire you to spread Satsang throughout.)', 'In a stick of sugarcane, its trunk (the lower part) is hard to chew, the upper portion is bland in taste and its centre portion is sweet. Similarly, it is convenient for you to worship God at present since you have the company of the great Sadhu. Formerly, satsangis were beaten and did not get food; and today there is convenience in every respect ‚Äì so worship God and do not be lazy.', '‚ÄúIf one fills many trunks with 1000 million packets of ash, locks and keeps them, and if when, someday, one needs them (to pay for something) one takes them out, will something useful come out?‚Äù Then (someone) said, ‚ÄúNo, Maharaj.‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúWithout the murti of God and without the Sadhu, all things upto Prakruti-Purush are packets of ash. If you forget the murti and go to any abode of the gods or the abode of any ishwar or the abode of any Purush, still, without the murti of Maharaj and without this Sadhu there is no (permanent) happiness or peace anywhere.‚Äù Having said this, Swami said, ‚ÄúSurpur narpur nƒÅgpur e tinme sukh nƒÅhi; KƒÅ sukh Harike charanme kƒÅ santanke mƒÅhi.‚Äù1', '1. There is no happiness in surpur (heaven), narpur (earth) or nagpur (nether-world); there is happiness only at the feet of God or his holy Sadhu.', '‚ÄúOn seeing the reflection of the moon fall on the water, the fish become happy and think that it, too, is a fish like them. But the fish do not know the moon as it is ‚Äì its orb, its lustre, its power and its capability. Also, on seeing a ship sailing in the ocean, a big fish believes that it is a fish like itself, but it does not know that a ship is able to cross the ocean and transport millions and trillions of rupees worth of goods. This is the analogy and its principle is that one is not able to know Maharaj and his Sadhu as they are, and their form, nature, virtues, power and capabilities ‚Äì just as a fish and large fish believe them (moon and ship) to be like themselves. Similarly, humans believe them (God and his holy Sadhu) to be like themselves, but they do not know them as they really are.‚Äù Saying this he had the shlok below recited:\\nAvajƒÅnanti mƒÅm mudhƒÅ mƒÅnushim tanumƒÅshritam;\\nParam bhƒÅvamajƒÅnanto mama bhutamaheshvaram.1\\n‚ÄúSuch a fool and dull-witted jiva considers them as like humans.

Without realizing its value, he burnt it in the stove and its scent was noticed by a rich businessman. Then, the businessman asked, ‚ÄòWho is so wealthy in this village that he burns bƒÅv sandalwood?‚Äô Then everyone said, ‚ÄòA woodcutter lives in this village.‚Äô So the businessman went there and took what little unburnt sandalwood was left in the stove and offered it daily to Shri Vishnu. And when he died he went to the abode of Vishnu. That is the analogy and its principle is that HemgopƒÅl represents this Bharatkhand and the bƒÅv sandalwood represents the human body. Without realizing its value, it is burnt up for women, wealth, sons, daughters, the world, pleasures and the body. We should not burn it like this. We should ensure that one attains the goal of life at any cost.‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúKoti janma lagi ragad hamƒÅri, varu Shambhu ke rahu kumƒÅri.‚Äù1', '1.

It is due to desires for worldly possessions, worldly enjoyments, one‚Äôs selfish body interests and bias. Of these, the extent to which the jiva is maligned by bias does not happen even by the enjoyment of the sense pleasures. Due to such bias, those who have maligned a senior sadhu have been consigned to the realm of ghosts. And if there is someone like this, he, too, will go there. As a result of this sin he suffers miseries such as having to eat faeces and drink urine. He suffers such misery, but does not get any happiness at all, anywhere.‚Äù ', 'One day, Swami awoke in the middle of the night and said, ‚ÄúSome think that Swami is on our side and some think that Swami is on our side.

Kapildev Bhagwan says to his mother, Devhuti, ‚ÄúIf a person maintains profound attachment towards the God-realized Sadhu just as resolutely as he maintains profound attachment towards his own relatives, then the gateway to liberation opens for him.‚Äù - Shrimad Bhagvat 3/25/20', 'Gopalanand Swami asked all the sadhus, ‚ÄúHow do you perform meditation and mƒÅnsi?‚Äù All of them said, ‚ÄúIn mƒÅnsi puja we meditate remembering where Maharaj used to sit, and offer food at the place he sat to eat.‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúHas anyone learnt meditation which is performed after overcoming the three bodies?‚Äù Then all asked, ‚ÄúHow can the three bodies be won over?‚Äù Swami replied, ‚ÄúWhen one sits in meditation and an insect bites, if the physical body is not allowed to move, then know that the physical body has been controlled; and if the meditation is performed without worldly thoughts, desires and wishes, know then that the subtle body has been controlled; and when sleep and laziness are not allowed to interfere in meditation then know that the causal body has been controlled. In this way, control the three bodies and meditate.‚Äù At that time Siddhanand Swami said, ‚ÄúThe causal body is hard like the black rock mountain and only by much effort can it be controlled. It is like when one wants to cut away stones from a well and one digs using a hammer and chisel, then by evening (only) a basketful of chippings will be removed ‚Äì that is how difficult it is.‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúIf we explode them then 200 cartloads of stones are removed. That is, we drill holes in the form of spiritual discourses and fill them with gunpowder in the form of absolute faith in God and then ignite them with fire in the form of the knowledge of the greatness and glory of God and his holy Sadhu. As a result ignorance in the form of the causal body, which is like the black mountain, is shattered. Thus, after making one brahmarup, we keep one in the service of Maharaj in Akshardham. This is not difficult.‚Äù', 'In Satya-yug man has a lifespan of 100,000 years, a deathbed of 1,000 years, and after a hundred years of terminal illness the jiva leaves the body; and today, one can go to Akshardham with the third gasp for breath, that is how easy it has been made. But as long as there is ignorance, happiness is believed to be in women, wealth, sons, daughters, homes, mansions, regal prosperity and royal wealth. Just as children build dirt houses, cows of broken mud pots and horses out of hollow stones and coconut shells, and feel happy about it, similarly, people attribute happiness to the above mentioned things. But when one acquires true spiritual knowledge, everything is negated. In the arid and flat region of BhƒÅl, a Brahmin was walking along and he met a cowherd, who asked, ‚ÄúO Brahmin, why are you so happy?‚Äù Then the Brahmin said, ‚ÄúWhy should I not be happy? I have walked twenty miles and finally found some water, so I will wash and bathe and have a snack.‚Äù Then the cowherd said, ‚ÄúDo not have such a heartbreaking expectation. I have just walked from there wearing these shoes and the appearance of water there is due to a mirage.‚Äù Then all the plans of the Brahmin collapsed. Similarly, when spiritual knowledge is attained everything is negated. The jivas, who are like deer, believe the material pleasures to be true and keep chasing after them ‚Äì just as a deer sees the water mirage and runs after it. Man also sees the mirage, but knows that it is an optical illusion. And one seated in the chariot of the Sun does not see the mirage of water; similarly, one with knowledge does not attach any importance to worldly objects.', 'When does satsang develop? When there are places like BadrikƒÅshram and Shvetdwip; the continuous company of great sadhus like Muktanand Swami, Gopalanand Swami and Swarupanand Swami; and a lifespan equal to a kalp of BrahmƒÅ during which one engages in learned discussion, then satsang develops. But without this, satsang does not develop. Then Swami said, ‚ÄúHas one accepted a guru? If a guru has been accepted, his virtues should develop in us, should they not?', 'Sarvopanishado gƒÅvo dogdhƒÅ GopƒÅlanandanaha', 'PƒÅrtho vatsah sudhirbhoktƒÅ dugdham GitƒÅmrutam mahat.1', '‚ÄúJust as God turned the Gita into a cow and Arjun into a calf and fed him milk, have you suckled anyone (as guru) like that? Those who have suckled enthusiastically like this do not retreat from observing moral codes, etc. But, as long as one has not overcome greed, lust, gluttony, attachment and ego, one has not sincerely accepted a guru. And one who has accepted a guru would never retreat from observing austerities, etc.', '1. The Upanishads are milk-giving cows; the milker is Gopalanandan Shri Krishna; the calf is Arjun; milk is the great (divine) nectar, i.e. Bhagvad Gita, and the intelligent are those who drink it (the Gita).', 'In Vartal, four Patels told Maharaj, ‚ÄúMaharaj, when we look at your holy feet (with the auspicious marks) you appear to be Purushottam and when we look at your body you appear to be human.‚Äù Then Maharaj said, ‚ÄúVairat BrahmƒÅ prayed at these holy feet for a period of his 50 years and 4¬Ω hours and then these holy feet have come on this earth. So understand what you can from this.‚Äù Then, someone asked, ‚ÄúWe have seen assemblies in many places, but how do we understand the fact that here all are looking at you with total concentration?‚Äù Maharaj said, ‚ÄúI have incarnated as the sun in the form of a Sadguru1 and all these lotuses (in the form of devotees), have blossomed and they are looking at me.‚Äù Then, after practising satsang, they went to their own homes. These are the qualities of a spiritual aspirant.', '1. Sadguru means Paramatma. Refers to Shriji Maharaj himself.', 'An ascetic came and said, ‚ÄúO Maharaj! You have done something very bad!‚Äù So Maharaj asked, ‚ÄúWhat bad thing have I done?‚Äù Then he said, ‚ÄúYou have arranged separate assemblies for men and women, which nobody had done. That is a very bad thing.‚Äù Then Maharaj said, ‚ÄúI have come from Anirdesh. That is, I am Purushottam and have come from Akshardham. I dislike mixed assemblies and my dislike is transmitted to others, otherwise men and women are not likely to stay separate.‚Äù Since Maharaj has a dislike they will remain separate, otherwise they will get together. Then somebody asked, ‚ÄúWhere does the mind of a man dwell?‚Äù Then Maharaj said, ‚ÄúJust today I have thought of this, that the mind of a man dwells on the private parts of a woman and the mind of a woman dwells on the private parts of a man.‚Äù In this way, he described everyone‚Äôs inner thoughts.', 'One or two pots of water cannot cool a red-hot iron frying pan weighing a hundred thousand kilos. The only way to cool the pan is to throw it into the Ganga. Then for ten to fifteen days waves as high as a tall building will rise and then ultimately the pan will become cool. Similarly, the jiva is burning red-hot by desires for the five types of sense pleasures and it cannot be cooled by staying just one or two days in the company of satsang. And for one who wants to cool the jiva from the effects of the sense pleasures, it takes ten to fifteen days for the desires to calm down and then the talks penetrate within. Then the jiva cools. But who comes to the Sadhu? One who comes to the Sadhu will have no deficiencies left. Such satsang has been attained, but without close association with the Satpurush nobody realizes it. And as long as one does not have association with the Satpurush, nothing has been achieved. Upon this, he recited a verse by Brahmanand Swami:', 'RƒÅj bhayo kahƒÅ kƒÅj saryo, MahƒÅrƒÅj bhayo kahƒÅ lƒÅj badhƒÅi;', 'ShƒÅh bhayo kahƒÅ vƒÅt badhi, patsƒÅha bhayo kahƒÅ ƒÅn firai.', 'Dev bhayo to kahƒÅ bhayo, ahamev badhyo trushnƒÅ adhikƒÅi;', 'Brahmamuni satsang vinƒÅ, sab aur bhayo to kahƒÅ bhayo bhƒÅi.1', 'Thus, until one has associated with the Satpurush, one has done nothing.', '1. If a person becomes a king, he proclaims that his reputation has increased; if he becomes an emperor he thinks his fame has spread more; when he becomes a deity, his ego increases and the desire for reaching still higher increases; but, Brahmamuni says that without satsang all that one attains is worthless.', 'Swami engaged in a question and answer dialog to the muktas of various abodes, however, the muktas were not able to answer his questions satisfactorily. He narrated this in his own words, ‚ÄúFirst, I went to Badrikashram and the muktas of Badrikashram were not able to win in the questions-and-answers debate. Then, I went to Shvetdwip and the muktas of Shvetdwip were not table to win either. Then, I went to Vaikunth and the muktas of Vaikunth were not able to win. Then, I went to Golok and the muktas of Golok did not win either. Then, I went to Akshardham. Those muktas provided satisfactory answers.‚Äù Then, Swami said to Gopalanand Swami, ‚ÄúThis is what happened today.‚Äù Gopalanand Swami replied, ‚ÄúMaharaj made it known that the gnƒÅn of the muktas of other abodes is like that (of that level). Only the muktas of Akshardham or the ekƒÅntik sadhus here possess the gnƒÅn of God‚Äôs form; but this gnƒÅn is nowhere else.‚Äù', 'The jiva does not hesitate in anything else, but hesitates in understanding Maharaj as Purushottam.

When he renounced his home and was walking down one road, a king‚Äôs female servant sat on the path with gold worth 10,000 rupees. She saw Govind Swami‚Äôs handsome appearance and said, ‚ÄúThis gold is yours and I am yours.‚Äù Govind Swami thought, ‚ÄúWhen one leaves to worship God, achievements come to hinder them.

To give them his own bliss, he gave his most precious item (i.e. Gunatitanand Swami) to the sadhus and satsangis of Sorath.

So, RƒÅdhikƒÅji quarrelled with ShridƒÅmƒÅ1 in Golok and Jay-Vijay quarreled with the Sanak2 sages in Vaikunth. From this, it follows that the causal body must not have been destroyed there.

For this, the Sadhu teaches the upƒÅsanƒÅ of God and through the codes enforces the observance of God‚Äôs commands. As a result of this, the causal body is destroyed.‚Äù Then after Vachanamrut Kariyani-12 was read with reference to this topic, Swami said, ‚ÄúIn this Vachanamrut, Maharaj has stated his principle.

So he reprimanded her and cursed her, saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be born in the home of a carpenter.‚Äù Radha also cursed Shridama, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be born as a demon.‚Äù As a result he was born as the demon Shankhchud (Narad Puran 2/81; Brahmavaivart Puran 2/46).', '2.

The light of Brahman has become diminished.‚Äù After saying this, he disappeared. Since that day, whatever I have done has been for the moksha of the jivas. One day, I asked Maharaj four questions about which duty I should concentrate on: first, to engage in meditation; second, to behave as ƒÅtmƒÅ; third, to serve the sick; or fourth, to talk about God. Of the four, which is the best for me? Please tell me. Then Maharaj said, ‚ÄúTalks of God are the best.‚Äù So from that day, I began to talk.

And Krupanand Swami used to say, ‚ÄòI would not have to observe a fast for transgressing the vow of celibacy in my dream. And if I did, my body would die.‚Äô That was his determination. And his fear of the vishays was such that, if he transgressed a minor command, he felt he had transgressed a major command. That was his fear. I observed this with my eyes one day.  And Krupanand Swami is like the river Ganga. The current of Ganga flows and no one can stop it from its path. Similarly, no one can stop his mind‚Äôs attachment to God‚Äôs form. One day, Sachchidanand Swami saw Krupanand Swami‚Äôs samƒÅdhi1 and said, ‚ÄúWe do not have the love equal to Krupanand Swami‚Äôs love.‚Äù One with that level of love is like the river Ganga.

And today, no one realizes the Sadhu as he is, and they will suffer a great loss! Why? Who else other than the great Sadhu reveal  Maharaj‚Äôs principle?

SamƒÅdhi in this context means an elevated state of extreme love for Maharaj.

Well, it is when there is mental discord with others that such unrighteousness enters. But if there is unity with each other (in the fellowship), then unrighteousness does not gain entry.‚Äù On this, he narrated a story told by Maharaj (Bhagwan Swaminarayan), ‚ÄúA king asked for a quiver of arrows and said, ‚ÄòLet the strongest among you, break this quiver.‚Äô Then, the strongest man tried but the quiver of arrows could not be broken. Then, taking a single arrow from the quiver, he told the weakest to break it. And he broke it instantly. Then the king told his senior courtiers, ‚ÄòSee, if you remain united like this quiver of arrows, then whoever the enemy is, it will not be able to defeat you and the kingdom will remain secure and prosperous.‚Äô‚Äù After narrating this example, Swami said, ‚ÄúIf you all ‚Äì sadhus, pƒÅrshads and brahmachƒÅris ‚Äì maintain unity like this, then no matter what type of internal enemies you face, they will not be able to defeat you. And if you do not stay united like this, then even the smallest of defects will drive you out of Satsang.‚Äù Then he continued, ‚ÄúSee, some do not even have anyone to make a willing pair and some are hypersensitive like pus-filled boils. They cannot even be told. Therefore, in these ten groups of sadhus, all of you stay with whom you are compatible.‚Äù', '1. When unrighteousness enters, no happiness remains for gods, men and sages.', 'Swami looked at a thorn bush (on the sea shore) and said, ‚ÄúThis bush has been scraped smooth by the sand, and even if it is (watered) with a hundred thousand kilometre ocean, it will not turn luscious green, since it has been abraded by the sand. Similarly, this jiva has been eroded by the material pleasures; but even by being immersed in this Satsang, which is like a great ocean of fresh water, it does not blossom, since other people, worldly pleasures and the body have eroded the jiva. This is plainly visible. Also, good virtues are destroyed by contact with the three types of bad company.1 But the jiva does not become happy unless it forsakes attachment to the body, relations and material pleasures.‚Äù Then Swami added, ‚ÄúThe jiva is seated within like a thief, but does not feel the need for God and his great Sadhu. And one does not have knowledge about one‚Äôs jiva. Just as a Muslim mounted a bullock2 took a stick in his hand and shouted, ‚ÄòWho should I kill and who should I not kill.‚Äô He boasted thus, but did not consider his own status; for who was he going to kill as he was neither a soldier nor a warrior?‚Äù Then Swami recited,', 'MotƒÅ thavƒÅnu manmƒÅ re dalmƒÅ ghanƒÅ dod,', 'TevƒÅ gun nathi tanmƒÅ re kƒÅ kare tu kod.3', '‚ÄúIn this way, the jiva desires much, but if one were to suffer a month of diarrhoea, one would realize (how weak man is). But, today, it behaves carefree (and imposes conditions on the Sadhu).‚Äù In this way, Swami spoke at great length.', '1. Three types of bad company: (1) External - company of those who lead one to break the codes of Satsang. (2) Internal - company within the Satsang-fold by which one‚Äôs understanding of God‚Äôs glory is diminished. (3) Within - One‚Äôs own base instincts which hinder spiritual progress.', '2. A century ago a short-legged bull was used to transport cargo. A Muslim sat on it thinking it was a horse and he was going to fight a war, shouting, ‚ÄúWho should I kill? And who should I not kill?‚Äù', '3. You have strong desires in the mind to become prominent, but you don‚Äôt have the required virtues to be great, so why keep such desires?', 'When one looks at the jiva it appears as if there is no spiritual aspiration for liberation. A genuine spiritual aspirant does not experience happiness or peace without God or his sadhu. Just as a pearl oyster in the ocean remains unaffected by the ocean water, but when drops of water from the svƒÅnt constellation fall, it enthusiastically accepts them and they will become pearls worth a hundred thousand rupees each. But when the water drops are accepted with subdued faith, they becomes pearls worth fifty thousand. And one that accepts fallen drops of water develops faulty pearls. Similarly, if an aspirant associates faithfully with this Satpurush, through mind, deed and words, then he becomes brahmarup. Then he recited the following:', 'And for one who does not have such faith perfection is attained only after many births.', 'One must associate with the Satpurush through mind, deeds and words. Then someone asked, ‚ÄúHow should one associate through mind, deeds and words?‚Äù To this Swami replied, ‚ÄúWith the body, perform deeds as per the commands of the Satpurush. Through speech, praise the countless virtues of the Satpurush. And in the mind, do not lose faith in the powers of the great Sadhu.

You‚Äôve not paid even one day‚Äôs worth of income.‚Äô1 So, you see, of all these people, the trader can be said to have the most accurate knowledge of the true worth of that diamond. It is the same with the glory of God. As one‚Äôs knowledge of God‚Äôs glory increases, one‚Äôs understanding of his glory increases.‚Äù To illustrate this, he had Vachanamrut Sarangpur-17 read.', '1.

What is this anirdesh?‚Äô Maharaj replied, ‚ÄòThis, your darbƒÅr, is nirdesh (definable), while compared to it your city is anirdesh (undefinable); earth is definable, while compared to it water is undefinable; water is definable, but compared to it light is undefinable; light is definable, while compared to it wind is undefinable; wind is definable, while compared to it space is undefinable; space is definable and compared to it ahamkƒÅr is undefinable; ahamkƒÅr is definable and compared to it mahatattva is undefinable; mahatattva is definable and compared to it PradhƒÅn-Purush is undefinable; Pradhan-Purush is definable and compared to it Prakruti-Purush is undefinable; Prakruti-Purush is definable, while Akshardham, which is above Prakruti-Purush, is undefinable. Residing from there I am having this letter written.‚Äô While Maharaj spoke all this, she looked at and focused on his murti and internalized it. This story was narrated by Maharaj.‚Äù', '1. Now I will seek a solution for this (final moksha), by travelling throughout the country and abroad; If someone can save me from (the cycles of birth and death), I‚Äôll surrender my head to him. - Nishkulanand Swami\\nThis couplet describes King Gopichand‚Äôs desire to search for a guru who will free him from the bondage of mƒÅyƒÅ.', '‚ÄúWhile Raghuvirji Maharaj was alive, happiness due to favorable place, time, etc., prevailed. Why? Because Maharaj favored him and did according to his wishes. Now that Raghuvirji Maharaj left his body, misery has been overflowing. For example, just as a major river overflows [causing a flood], misery is overflowing. Just look at the misery created by kings - they did not provide justice to the landowners of BhenshjƒÅl or JƒÅyavƒÅ. They also did not provide justice to the brƒÅhmin devotee of Akhodad. These are the types of miseries. Therefore, we have pleaded with Maharaj to make two ƒÅchƒÅryas like Raghuvirji Maharaj and one king like Gaya; so then, one billion people will worship God from the two hundred thousand that worship God currently. This is the wish we made.‚Äù Then, the devotees said, ‚ÄúO Maharaj! Since you have wished, good things will happen.‚Äù', '‚ÄúWhat I know cannot be told to anyone, but today I will tell you a little.‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúWithout explaining it, spiritual knowledge cannot be gained and without gaining spiritual knowledge, infatuation is not overcome. And for one who has attained understanding like the great Sadhu, except for the murti of Maharaj and Akshardham, everything from here to Prakruti-Purush appears like waste! How can one become infatuated with that? This is how Sarvanivasanand Swami understood, so his focus remained unattached to material objects. One day, he asked me, ‚ÄòWith what (worldly materials) should I perform the worship and service of Maharaj?‚Äô Then I replied, ‚ÄòJust keep looking at the murti.‚Äô So, Sarvanivasanand Swami said, ‚ÄòThat is exactly what I am doing, but if I tell this to anyone, they will pick up my bed and throw it in the waste dump. That is how hard they would find it.‚Äô But without the murti of Maharaj food is like faeces and drink is like urine. So, as long as there is infatuation for worldly objects, this talk is not understood. Such is the understanding of the great.‚Äù', 'Swami called a devotee and said, ‚ÄúHave my darshan as this body exists for you, since the god of death is being kept at bay.‚Äù Then Swami added, ‚ÄúWhen one becomes separated from such a Sadhu, one should feel pain comparable to that of having fallen into hell! Since such pain is not felt, has the jiva really attached to the Satpurush? No. As long as the jiva is not attached to the Satpurush, one becomes engrossed in this world, its material pleasures and the body.‚Äù Further, Swami said, ‚ÄúI have to complete thousands of tasks, but if I forget God even for the fraction of a second it takes to blink, then I feel pain like as if my head has been split open.‚Äù Then someone asked, ‚ÄúYou accomplish thousands of tasks, yet continually remember God like an uninterrupted flow of oil. How is this possible?‚Äù Then Swami answered, ‚ÄúDo you ever forget your body?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúNo, Maharaj.‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúIf you forget your body, then I will forget Maharaj‚Äôs murti. Since, just as a fish moves, swims and acts in water, I walk, talk and do all tasks immersed in the form of Maharaj. But forgetting Maharaj I never do anything. One who does not know this fact will attribute faults even to the great Sadhu, will himself be tormented and will torment others. Such a faultfinder will not be liberated from the cycle of births and deaths even in tens of millions of years. That is a fundamental truth.‚Äù', '‚ÄúWe want to turn this jiva from a fly into a sun.1 That cannot happen without great efforts!‚Äù Then someone asked, ‚ÄúHow does the jiva turn from a fly into the sun?‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúThis sun, at some time, was made from a fly. It has become so because of the power in the upƒÅsanƒÅ of Purushottam. Due to the glory of this upƒÅsanƒÅ one is able to feel fulfilled and accomplished and without this upƒÅsanƒÅ, one feels unfulfilled and remains wishful.‚Äù Then Swami had the ‚ÄòGangƒÅjalio Well‚Äô Vachanamrut (Vachanamrut Gadhada II-67) read and said, ‚ÄúOne becomes what one believes Maharaj to be (if one believes that Maharaj is totally free from all blemishes, one also becomes free from all blemishes). Thereafter, how can unfulfillment and wishes remain? They do not remain.', '‚ÄúTrue knowledge of God‚Äôs form is never likely to be destroyed. Even by the fire of digestion, lightning or the Vadvanal fire, the knowledge of God is not likely to be destroyed. This knowledge is eternal and immortal. Just as Purushottam, Akshar and the liberated souls of Akshardham are eternal, similarly, this knowledge is also eternal.‚Äù', '1. That is, a spiritually weak person becomes spiritually strong.', 'Swami had Vachanamrut Kariyani-8 (‚ÄòThe Sagun-Nirgun Forms of God‚Äô) read and then said, ‚ÄúNobody knows how to explain the form of God, since the talks are beyond logic and they do not fit into anybody‚Äôs system of logic. And previous ƒÅchƒÅryas of philosophy have described the form of God, but nobody has been able to describe it in the way Maharaj has.‚Äù Then he said, ‚ÄúRead it again.‚Äù So, that Vachanamrut was read again and then Swami said, ‚ÄúMaharaj has described sagun and nirgun as two special divine powers of his own murti. And the original form that beholds both of these two forms is the manifest human form which is speaking before you i.e. Shriji Maharaj himself.‚Äù Then he said, ‚ÄúIf ten scriptural scholars from Vadodara, ten scriptural scholars from Surat, ten scriptural scholars from Ahmedabad, ten scriptural scholars from Kashi and thus thousands of such scriptural scholars get together, would such an occasion to discuss these topics (of sagun and nirgun) arise?‚Äù Rupshankar replied, ‚ÄúNo, Maharaj. Such an occasion would not be raised by the scriptural scholars.‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúThat is how it is. But, in the world, the authority of the scriptural scholars counts for a lot. But, only Maharaj or a sadhu like Gopalanand Swami are able to describe the true form of God. But nobody else can. And this fact is superior than ten million meditations, since even Shukji, after emerging from meditation, described the manifest human form of God.‚Äù At this point, the bell tolled and Swami went for darshan.', '‚ÄúA 1000-year-old khijdo tree produces inedible finger-like pods, while a 5-year-old mango tree yields delicious mangoes. That is the example and its principle is that no matter how learned a scholar of the scriptures or an orator of traditions and history may be, if he does not know this manifest God and manifest Sadhu, he is unproductive like the khijdo and in his company one will not experience peace or happiness. Whereas one who has not studied much, may be young and may not be of high birth, but if he develops faith in this manifest God (Bhagwan Swaminarayan) and realizes this Sadhu to be a God-realized Sadhu, then he is like a mango tree and in his company one experiences peace and happiness. Therefore, do not associate with one who is like a khijdo and associate with one who is like a mango tree.‚Äù Then, Swami recited a shlok1 to illustrate this point and said, ‚ÄúA Brahmin may possess the twelve holy attributes,2 but if he does not know the manifest form of God then a devotee of God from the lowest caste is superior to him. This is described in the scriptures. Therefore, recognize a true devotee of God and associate with him, so that this becomes the last birth.

One should use judgement when following commands.‚Äù On that, Swami explained, ‚ÄúIn the beginning, Maharaj gave a command to save a portion of meals for cows and dogs before eating. Some sadhus wasted two to four lƒÅddus made by devotees to follow that command. Some wise sadhus did not follow this command strictly; therefore, Ramdasjibhai and other devotees were pleased.‚Äù Swami gave another example, ‚ÄúMaharaj had also commanded that, if someone came back after discharging their bowels, one should stand up. We were in Jetalpur once, where a sadhu came after discharging his bowels and we did not get up. That sadhu developed an aversion toward us and became mad as a result and left.‚Äù Swami gave a third example, ‚ÄúMaharaj asked the sadhus to wash their feet and save the charanƒÅmrut (water drained after washing the feet) and give it to him on the pretext of giving it to his horse to drink. Everyone gave the charanƒÅmrut except Nityanand Swami. Maharaj himself drank the charanƒÅmrut of the sadhus instead of giving it to his horse; therefore, the sadhus regretted giving it to Maharaj, whereas Nityanand Swami had no regret. Thus, one should use judgement in following commands.‚Äù', 'Satsang, the God-realized state and the murti of God ‚Äì all three are rare. But we have attained them.

He wore torn clothes like a pauper, begged for his food and hid the chintƒÅmani. Thus, he pretended to be poor and left the kingdom, keeping the chintƒÅmani.

I was disappointed when the building of this mansion was started and thought about when it will finish and when I will be able to deliver talks? Since, if this body perishes, the talks will remain undelivered. I feel that I should sit in a hut, collect some grains and talk to all the people of the world.

But that is not a deficiency, since, seeing the Lord of Akshardham means that Akshardham has certainly been included (in that vision). So, keep looking at this murti that has been attained.

Because there have been many avatƒÅrs, but we have attained Maharaj who is Purushottam. And there are many in Satsang today who are like the other avatƒÅrs. One should understand the greatness of Satsang this way and make our upƒÅsanƒÅ firm. There is only one Purushottam, who propagated the pure ways (of satsang). The others allowed mingling of men and women and never separated them.‚Äù In this way, Swami spoke about the supremacy of Maharaj.', 'Do not hoard too many material objects, otherwise depression will arise and strong desires will remain. Objects are for the body, but the body is described as the enemy of the jiva, since it does not allow the jiva to offer worship to God or to read scriptures. So, by overcoming body-consciousness, all faults are overcome.', '‚ÄúPlease do not blame me. I just inform and leave it to you. Since, now I am old and will not live much longer, I am expressing my views. Understand and live a pure life, otherwise there will be a big difference in your final liberation.', '‚ÄúIf at this time one contracted an illness like diarrhoea, colic or worms then one would have to stay awake all night. But one does not sit even for a short time in meditation and sleeps the whole night.‚Äù On the night of Ashadh vad 6, he talked in this way. ‚ÄúAnyway, the body is an enemy and will make one do as per its wishes. It will make one clean everything, including faeces, but will not allow one to meditate.‚Äù', 'Type:  Keyword  Exact']\n",

Here, we do not have contact with the vishays; therefore, it is proper. However, if we acquire sweets everyday, then we would not remain without eating. That is the nature of the jiva. Therefore, it is best that we do not get sweets.‚Äù', 'In this Satsang there is happiness, dharma, devotion, spiritual knowledge, detachment and other noble karmas. But everywhere else there is fire (i.e. decay and destruction). Some are like animals who do not know how to speak and do not have any sense of discrimination.

In that, where the Sant resides is the favorable place; anywhere else is unfavorable. There are many (unfavorable) places, such as Arabsthan and Makaran. Currently, the time is favorable, hence, we are able to worship God and remain happy. However, one may die due to an unfavorable time. Take the example of a boat that sinks and 200 people die at once by drowning. And when Surat was on fire, many died at once by burning. Was the death of all at the same time predetermined? Actually, we should understand that this was due to an unfavorable time.', 'When lust, anger, ego, jealousy and body-consciousness are all overcome, then God and his holy Sadhu will be pleased.', 'This Gangaji broke through the mountains to merge with the ocean. Gangaji, indeed, can merge since when there is abundant water this is what happens. But these five types of sense pleasures are even tougher. Since, they entice even the likes of BrahmƒÅ, Shiv, etc. Indra was cursed and had a thousand boils,1 and Chandra became tainted. Such greats, and Ravan and others experienced misery. The sense pleasures tricked Saubhari and robbed Parashar, Ekalshrungi and many others of their merits. Therefore, just do not associate with the sense pleasures. Maharaj has manifested and kept a distance from sense pleasures. Nobody else has maintained this distance and even the great avatƒÅrs have caused disputes. But nobody has propagated this path. And Maharaj has said in the Vedras,2 ‚ÄúO Paramhansas! A man who has not been slain by the sharp blade of a sword in the form of women is a god of even the gods. So, that blade is by no means insignificant, it is very sharp. Therefore, do not let its contact arise.‚Äù', '1. Indra was attracted by the beauty of Ahalya, wife of Gautam Rishi.

This is not a small attainment. See, if someone has one or two million rupees, they will not come with him (when he dies). Even the wealthy cannot eat more than a pound of food.

After a 100 such years, the reign of Vairat Narayan is complete. So tell me, what is our lifespan before it? And why does the jiva continue to chant ‚Äòmine, mine‚Äô? Since, there is nothing permanent up to Prakruti-Purush. Therefore, achieve your work in this short time. And work in such a way that the goal is attained at any cost.', 'One day, after reading the Vachanamrut, Swami said, ‚ÄúThis Vachanamrut contains the essence of the four Vedas, six shƒÅstras1 and eighteen Purans. In it Maharaj has talked about his principles and they should be studied. Oh! What great benefit have we gained? See, out of compassion God has come for us from so far, but this jiva has no desire to worship God. He has come all the way from Akshardham. Now, like a woman who becomes a sati by force, similarly, the jiva is also forcibly made to worship God. The scriptures also talk only about dharma, wealth and desires.

There, they will have four hands and much trouble. What good is that? That is not proper. If one understands Maharaj to be Shri Krishna, then they will go to Golok where there are cows, calves, and cow-herders. What good is that? Therefore, there is no happiness like that in Akshardham. So understand Maharaj to be Purushottam. He even mentions in the Vachanamrut, ‚ÄòI will make you as you understand me to be.‚Äô1 So understanding Maharaj to be Purushottam, you will go to Akshardham, which will never be destroyed. On the contrary, the process of time (kƒÅl) consumes everything including Prakruti-Purush.‚Äù', 'One person said, ‚ÄúWe should stay where God keeps us. All the abodes of God are the same. Why do you unnecessarily argue?‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúThe stars and the moon cannot be described as being the same. And even Maharaj has said that one must understand there is a clear difference between the avatƒÅrs and the source of all avatƒÅrs, just as there is a difference between the king and his minister, and there is a difference between the arrow and the archer. The minister may be very powerful and give orders; he may be great, but when he goes to the king, he salutes the king many times and only then is he able to take his seat. And the king‚Äôs orders prevail over him. Difference between the avatƒÅrs and their source is similar to this.‚Äù', 'Regarding this, Swami had Vachanamrut (Gadhada II-9) read and said, ‚ÄúIf one says other abodes and Akshardham are the same and one says other avatƒÅrs and Maharaj are the same, then one should believe he is a sinner greater than one who commits the five grave sins and should not keep his company.‚Äù In this way, Swami defeated him by reading the Vachanamrut.', '1. The words of Vachanamrut Gadhada II-67 which Swami paraphrases are: ‚ÄúIn whatever way a devotee of God has realised God - i.e., ‚ÄòGod possesses this many powers; He possesses this much charm; He is the embodiment of bliss;‚Äô and so on - that is the extent to which he has realised the greatness of God.

This includes granting samƒÅdhi, granting liberation, etc. Therefore, they have powers similar to God... And there are many today who have no desires for women and wealth.‚Äù', 'On that, Swami mentioned many pƒÅrshads and sadhus and showed that Maharaj‚Äôs devotees were greater than the devotees of previous avatƒÅrs. Then, he gave an analogy of the other avatƒÅrs, ‚ÄúThe name of the emperor of Dehli is SherakhƒÅ. No one else can be called SherakhƒÅ. One soldier whose name was SherakhƒÅ went to Delhi. The emperor asked him, ‚ÄòWhy is your name SherakhƒÅ?‚Äô The soldier said, ‚ÄòI am SherakhƒÅ just by name, like pagarkhƒÅ (shoes), chabarkhƒÅ (scraps of paper), and labarkhƒÅ.‚Äô This is the difference (between the avatƒÅrs and Maharaj).3 And this understanding is proper. If one does not have this type of understanding, then one‚Äôs unerstanding is incomplete. Therefore, Maharaj is the cause of all avatƒÅrs and only understand him to be supreme.‚Äù Swami thus spoke in the assembly. Then, he went for the shangƒÅr ƒÅrti darshan.', '1. RƒÅtri-pralay, also known as the nimitta-pralay when BrahmƒÅ‚Äôs day ends and night begins. During this time, the three loks are destroyed. BrahmƒÅ‚Äôs one day is equal to 4,320,000,000 human years.', '2. The purport of Gunatitanand Swami‚Äôs words here is that during the rƒÅtri-pralay, Shwetdvip and Badrikashram are destroyed, but during prƒÅkrut pralay or ƒÅtyantik pralay all abodes except Akshardham are destroyed.', 'Explanation: Shwetdvip and Badrikashram are located on the earth. Therefore, at the end of BrahmƒÅ‚Äôs day (known as rƒÅtri-pralay or nimitta pralay), the earth along with the 10 realms are destroyed. Therefore, these two abodes are also destroyed. However, Golok and Vaikunth remain intact.  The liberated souls of Shwetdvip and Badrikashram migrate to Vaikunth from there.', 'However, during prƒÅkrut pralay or ƒÅtyantik pralay, all of the abodes except Akshardham are destroyed. Of the infinite brahmƒÅmds, each brahmƒÅnd is comprised of each abode. During prƒÅkrut pralay, the creation of Pradhan-Purush - which is the brahmƒÅnd - is destroyed. During ƒÅtyantik pralay, the creation of Prakruti-Purush - which are the inifinte brahmƒÅnds - are all destroyed simultaneously. Along with this destruction, all abodes are destroyed except Akshardham, because Akshardham transcends Prakruti-Purush.', '3. By the example of the emperor and soldier having a similar name, Swami is explaining that even if someone has a name similar to a great emperor, it does not make that person an emperor. Similarly, despite that previous avatƒÅrs have been mentioned as Purushottam or Bhagwan in the scriptures, only Maharaj is Purushottam.', 'The ƒÅtmƒÅ is extremely luminous. Believe it to be separate from the gross, subtle and causal bodies, and contemplate that ‚ÄòI am ƒÅtmƒÅ and this manifest Purushottam Bhagwan is ever present within me.‚Äô And all these talks are stated in the ‚ÄòVishalyakarni Herbal Medicine‚Äô Vachanamrut (Gadhada III-39). Such talks are, to some extent, in all the Vachanamruts and they may be absent only in some. The contemplation of the ƒÅtmƒÅ in the mind should continue, ‚ÄòI am ƒÅtmƒÅ, akshar.‚Äô And if this is continually done, one attains the state of akshar. An example was given on this, Maharaj asked a dhedh boy, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù Then he said, ‚ÄúI am a dhedh.‚Äù So Maharaj said, ‚ÄúYou say ‚ÄòI am ƒÅtmƒÅ‚Äô ten times.‚Äù So he repeated it ten times. Then Maharaj asked, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù He once again replied, ‚ÄúI am a dhedh.‚Äù Then Maharaj said, ‚ÄúSay ‚ÄòI am ƒÅtmƒÅ‚Äô a hundred times.‚Äù So he said this a hundred times. Then Maharaj asked, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù Again he said, ‚ÄúI am a dhedh.‚Äù Then Maharaj said, ‚ÄúSee how firmly he identifies himself with the body.‚Äù Saying this, Maharaj said, ‚ÄúIf one continually contemplates in the mind on the ƒÅtmƒÅ, one becomes aksharrup.‚Äù And in the Shikshapatri, this is written in the shlok ‚ÄòNijƒÅtmƒÅnam brahmarupam‚Äô. And also it is said in the Purushottampatri, ‚ÄúOnly one who believes the ƒÅtmƒÅ as aksharrup is a (true) satsangi.‚Äù Therefore, there is no alternative but to emphasize this view. In this way, Swami talked in the middle of the night.', 'One person asked a question, ‚ÄúThe great Sadhu wants to unite the jiva eternally with God. But, for some aspirants he insists more and unites them, while with others he just engages in ordinary talks. Why is this? Is it because of laxity in faith?‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúThe former‚Äôs impressions from the past are strong, hence God inspires the great Sadhu to insist strongly for him. And the latter devotee‚Äôs past impressions are less and his faith is also less.‚Äù Then someone asked, ‚ÄúHow can faith be increased?‚Äù So Swami said, ‚ÄúWhen one realizes that the great Sadhu who is speaking to him is not an ordinary man speaking. He realizes that it is God who is speaking through him and considers him to be God. Also, he performs his service, offers worship to him and respects him. In this way, faith develops. Then he attaches the aspirant with God.‚Äù', 'There are four barriers for the jiva to overcome that I have thought of. The first is to know Purushottam; second is to recognize the Sadhu; third is to remove one‚Äôs attachment for the five types of sense objects; and fourth, this body and jiva have become one, so the ƒÅtmƒÅ must be understood as separate. These four obstacles are tough. Two of them are particularly so. One is to remove one‚Äôs affection for the five types of sense objects and second, to know the jiva as separate from the body.', 'Swami praised Jadbharat and said, ‚ÄúO! They raised a sword to kill Jadbharat but he did not get scared and said, ‚ÄòSins will be destroyed if they kill me.‚Äô‚Äù Then, Swami praised Ambarish even more and said, ‚ÄúWhen one develops ƒÅtma-nishthƒÅ like that, then that is good. On the contrary, our understanding dries up (it is lost) at critical moments; but we should not let that happen. And it is not proper to quarrel for books or other items.‚Äù', 'God‚Äôs avatƒÅrs are infinite. Today, with Maharaj‚Äôs manifestation, a thousand avatƒÅrs of God have also manifested with him. But among all of them, Maharaj is the source of the avatƒÅrs. We should clearly understand that.', 'One person asked a question, ‚ÄúHow can one reach all the way to Maharaj and you?‚Äù Then Swami said, ‚ÄúBy knowing Maharaj as Purushottam and by following the commands of God, one can reach [us].‚Äù', 'Please be sensible and do not wish for powers, and if they are attained, then one is likely to do anything. So, there is no value in this. What is meant by remaining poised in times of adverse circumstances? Swami said, ‚ÄúWhen wealth is lost, one‚Äôs son dies or one cannot find food to eat, then at such times understanding helps. Once, a businessman went abroad and returned with a ship full of ten million gold coins. When he placed his foot on the plank leading to the shore to disembark, the ship sank. Then the businessman said, ‚ÄòOh! What a misfortune.‚Äô But then he reasoned, ‚ÄòWhen I was born, did I have any gold?‚Äô Similarly, a mendicant found a rope while walking on the road. He kept it on his shoulder, but it slipped off. Then, after he had walked a little distance, he realized it fell. Then he said, ‚ÄòNever mind. Mujku rassƒÅ pƒÅyƒÅ ja no‚ÄôtƒÅ ‚Äì I never had the rope in the first place.‚Äô Thus, think in this way and remain happy. Also, in the Kakabhai‚Äôs Vachanamrut (Gadhada I-70) it is said that if there are ten people in the house and all of them are destined to die, but then if one of them is saved, is that too little? Thus, understand in this way.‚Äù', 'The day Swami came from Vartal, he said, ‚ÄòƒÄkuti-chitichƒÅpalyarahitƒÅ nishparigrahƒÅhƒÅ.‚Äô1 When someone has these 64 attributes,2 then one becomes a sadhu. If one continuously associates, day and night, until the final dissolution of the universe, with sadhus such as Gopalanand Swami, Krupanand Swami, Swarupanand Swami and Muktanand Swami, then one can become a complete sadhu.

You have attained something greater.‚Äù', 'There is no talk like that of ƒÅtmƒÅ-realization. One should continually think, ‚ÄúI am akshar and Purushottam is seated within me.‚Äù Maharaj has said this in many places. This is subtle devotion, through which ultimate liberation will be attained. But the previously described devotion is the physical path and by it ‚Äì ‚ÄòƒÄtyantiki yatra na mrutyuhƒÅsaha‚Äô1 ‚Äì such liberation in which the fear of death is eliminated is not attained. And due to ego, one offers such physical devotion, singlehandedly, that would be offered by four people. One performs service, lifts stones and cooks food, but all this devotion is offered since praise is received. One does this but perfection is not attained by this. ‚ÄòKiyƒÅ bƒÅlpanƒÅni ramat, kiyƒÅ pƒÅmvo siddhono mat.‚Äô2 Therefore, only when, someday, this talk is practiced will there be final moksha.', '1.

Therefore, renounce such a person1 and practise discretion, which is described as the tenth treasure,2 then you will gain happiness. Oh! There is no limit to the jiva‚Äôs ignorance. It is engrossed in worldly activities, and visiting kings and householders. So what can we say? Just like those engrossed in worldly matters, one struggles to read the two Vachanamruts of the discourse at night and then returns to the same routine. But, God is not pleased by this, so act thoughtfully.', '1.

Thus, there is no worth in all this. So, associate with this Sadhu and attain saintliness. Money and other objects will remain unused and one will pass away. And if one offers devotion or performs meditation at night thinking, ‚ÄúAll of them just eat and sleep and only I pray and meditate,‚Äù then all merits are burnt away. And even after attaining greatness, if one hankers for disciples, what should we say? The water in the pot is the same, but after putting sugar crystals in it, it is secretly fed to a disciple ‚Äì in this way the master steals, and if the disciple does not do the same, then he himself teaches him by secretly revealing how to steal what he needs. In this way, by trickery, his whole life is wasted. By this technique, both the teacher and disciple, together, get their work done.

There was an ascetic called Gulabgar, who, on seeing everyone else in meditation, sat with his head covered. Then thoughts of money, cattle and collections sprung in him mind. Annoyed, he got up and said, ‚ÄúGet up, get up, why are you seated? There is unfinished work, so let us do it.‚Äù That is what happens. Therefore, do not allow unnecessary thoughts to arise.', '1.

As for me, Atmanand Swami rebuked me a lot and so I stayed with him. I used to stay with Brahmanand Swami, but left him as he did not rebuke. So, without it being pointed out, the deficiency will not go. And one goes repeatedly to a place where a good meal is available, but if someone invited Kevalatmanand Swami for a full meal, he would say, ‚ÄúWe have asked for a letter of permission from Swami in Junagadh. If we get it then only we will accept (the meal).‚Äù He would make excuses in this way, decline the meal and accept only simple food; and then stay two days and leave. But, by eating a sumptuous meal of sweets, oily, spicy, hot food in abundance and then resting, desires and anger will increase. And we sadhus should live as per the three scriptures ‚Äì Dharmamrut, Nishkam Shuddhi and Shikshapatri. This is what Maharaj has said. And live as per the wish of Maharaj. It is said, ‚ÄòBrahmƒÅnand rehano bhalo rukhme.‚Äô1 If more clothes and objects than permitted in the three scriptures are kept or eaten then it will result in bondage.

And the latter is always praying, ‚ÄòWhen will I get a chance?‚Äô Such people are described by Maharaj in the Vachanamrut (Gadhada II-47) as like a wretched person and a dog. One who has affection (for God and the Satpurush) will appreciate this talk. Otherwise, even if a hundred thousand talks are given, they are not believed.‚Äù', 'What is the affection of this world like? Saying this, Swami gave the example of a Patel in detail, ‚ÄúHis family had such affection for him that they would die for him. Yet, on the advice of a sadhu, he pretended to fall ill and the sadhu prepared milk (with an invoked mantra that the Patel will live and whoever drank it will die), but nobody drank it.

Just as an old buffalo is not given proper fodder, Muktanand Swami says, in this world all insult the old.

The following day, when he went to bathe, Bhattaji asked the Brahmin, ‚ÄúWhy is it that you have stopped eating and drinking? Your son has died, but has the throne of Udaipur become vacant? Well, one Brahmin has died, so there will be one person less begging for alms. So what!‚Äù Then that Brahmin (father) thought and said, ‚ÄúThis is true.‚Äù Then he said, ‚ÄúI would have died in fifteen days, but you have kept me alive.‚Äù Are there insufficient farmers in the land?

Similarly, this body is like the pit of a leather tanner and the jiva sits in it happily. This body is filled with bones, pus, saliva, faeces, and mucous and waste pours out from the nine gates.2 It is merely a bag of waste which is covered in skin and is described as perishable. Therefore, it is not of any real value. Break one‚Äôs attachment from it and attach to the ƒÅtmƒÅ.

And if you do not do that, then there is much millet in this mandir that rots. So, come and stay here for four months and worship God. Later, this association will not be attained. So, where there is a speaker with the highest spiritual wisdom, ensure that you keep his company and then remember and contemplate on the things that you have experienced. Maharaj has also said in the Shikshapatri and the Vachanamrut that without association of the Satpurush, knowledge is not possible. And among the eight factors of place, time, etc., association (satsang) is described as the best. And if the other seven are unfavourable and only company (of the Satpurush) is good, then the great Sadhu makes them favourable. Therefore, maintain association. Everything is included in this.', 'Whatever is dear to the master is given to the disciple. A father has a wife in his heart, so he enforces a wife in the son‚Äôs heart. Similarly, the Sadhu is fond of God, so he implants him in the jiva‚Äôs heart. And, just as one‚Äôs hunger is not satiated without eating, one remains cold without warming oneself, and without the sun darkness is not removed; similarly, ignorance is not overcome without close association with the great Sadhu. A learned can teach but what will an uneducated person teach? Since, at the root he has no knowledge, so how can he give it?', 'Guru bin gnƒÅn nahi, guru bin dhyƒÅn nahi.', 'Guru bin ƒÅtmavichƒÅr na lahat he.1', 'Similarly, without a truly great Sadhu, nothing happens.

Similarly, [God] has never come here before and Bharat-khand is said to belong to Nar-NƒÅrƒÅyan Dev, so he has brought him as a guide (i.e. used his name for familiarity). This should be considered as Maharaj‚Äôs human-like action - this is what Maharaj himself said. And all of these talks are new, the sadhus are new, and the niyams are new. Maharaj said, ‚ÄúI brought these niyams and sadhus from Akshardham.‚Äù', 'A servant does not use the objects to be used by his master.

Where is Shivji?‚Äù Parvatiji was embarrassed and returned to Shivji. Shivji asked what happened but Parvatiji concealed the incident. Shivji recounted the whole incident in meditation and realized what Parvatiji had done.', 'Because Sati took the form of Sitaji, Shivji felt remorse and thought that he cannot love Parvatiji any longer since she took the form of Sitaji. He told Parvatiji that he could no longer accept her since she posed as his Ishtadev Ramchandraji‚Äôs wife. Therefore, for many years Parvatiji suffered the separation from Shivji.', '[Ram Charit Manas: Bal-Kand/48-55]', 'There are three types of people in this Satsang: those who convert good people into bad people, those who make inward-focused people into outward-focused people and those who make one who is aloof from worldly matters become attached to them. There are such people even in the mandir. So recognize them and shun them. If someone keeps company of one who is focused on sense gratification or one who is money-oriented, then after six months they would isolate a devotee from Satsang. Recognize them, but do not associate with them. Associating with one who is money-oriented will lead to disastrous consequences. We have to leave both and become ƒÅtmƒÅ-centred.', 'To make efforts for food, a place to sleep, servants and worldly objects is not the path of a sadhu. If the right path of a sadhu is lost, then time is wasted. Therefore, spiritual knowledge should be acquired, since, apart from that nothing will remain at the time of dissolution of the universe. But spiritual knowledge will not be lost even in the final dissolution of all creation and that spiritual knowledge is with us. We are staying here amid all these activities, but even if we stay in the jungle, we will be happy. We need food once (a day) and if we have a cotton blanket then we do not need other clothing, since when we stayed in the forest, we stayed only with this blanket. It protected from the cold, sun and even rain heavy enough to soak a thick blanket. When such an attitude is cultivated what more is needed?

He has done his jiva great harm, since he has perceived a fault in a great sadhu.‚Äù Muktanand Swami was eating and one person thought, ‚ÄúWhy is this senior sadhu eating like this?‚Äù Then, in whatever food he looked at, he saw worms. This continued for fifteen days. He humbly bowed to Muktanand Swami and then everything returned to normal. Therefore, do not see faults in any sadhu.', 'Even if one has ten million rupees, it will not be of any use. Wherever it is it will be wasted. In Agra a 180 million rupee tomb has been made, but if grains for that many rupees had been bought, God had been worshipped and spiritual discourses delivered, then how much peace would have been attained? We may increase the ploughs (i.e. farming activities) by a hundredfold but what will that do? It will cause misery. That is not the way of a sadhu. Much good results from spiritual discourses. In the last session of spiritual discourses many (sadhus) gave up their separate kitchens and separate seats of study, thus echoing the power of spiritual talks. Wealth, whether it is accumulated or given to someone else to keep, does not remain. Only that which is in one‚Äôs destiny remains. Therefore, become free of lust, greed and desire for tasty foods ‚Äì then God is pleased.', 'This association (of the great Sadhu) is attained because of one‚Äôs great merit from their past birth; therefore, you have come for this association. Those who do not come have some grave sins (from their past births). You will receive the fruit (of this association) today, tomorrow, in a month, or one year; and you will benefit greatly. Some think though, we associate and yet we do not realize anything. However, we add a congealing agent (into the milk), and it will become yoghurt and then ghee after churning (i.e. ghee is obtained after many processes and time). These talks are very rare! And Satsang has increased tremendously and will spread throughout the world, but where will one find someone who speaks like this? And money will come by cartloads and mansions will be built, but one will not find these (talks)! Now, one should not wish for anything else. Ever since this jiva has gained understanding, it has farmed and sold (crop) and it still receives bread and grains. However, if one earns huge piles of money, what will happen? One will encounter misery. Therefore, since we have attained God, whatever happens is according to his wish. And God has accepted responsibility for giving us food and clothing so he will give it to us.', 'In the past, armies, bandits, and others attacked or looted. Some could not find food to eat because of famines, insects destroying crops, rodent infestation, or disease - such were the great catastrophes. In contrast, it appears the favorable times likes today had never come before. Therefore, this is the opportunity to worship God. O! I stayed in the forest for 22 years. I got food to eat every three days. We stayed in the midst of cold, heat, rain, and snow. We took the shelter of grass bales with one blanket - such are the hardships we endured.', 'Then, Swami explained the three miseries of adhyƒÅtma, adhibhut, and adhidaiv. AdhyƒÅtma is the body contracting disease. Adhibhut is misery caused by snakes, savage animals, etc. Adhidaiv is misery caused by locusts, rodents, etc. sent by the deities. These cease when one worships God. And if one truly worships God, then he looks at us (protects us) directly - that is how merciful God is. Regarding that, Swami said, Shri Krishna said that all of the Yadavs, Lakshmi and the other queens, and my body is not as dear to me as Uddhavji. This is how compassionate he is. Therefore, we should become like that.', 'What can be said of one who expects a bullock cart? His heart does not engage in worship and he remains upset. This is like having a mad man ride a ship.1 Do not do that. One should ask a great Sadhu, ‚ÄúThis is a problem that I have, so tell me that which will benefit my jiva.‚Äù ‚ÄòHu balihƒÅri e vairƒÅgya ne‚Äô  O! Who am I? Think upon that. One who determines this is a true person.2', '1. If one has a mad man ride a boat, instead of sitting calmly, he will jump around and make the boat tip over, causing everyone to drown. Nishkulanand Swami has mentioned this in a kirtan: Ek vat vali sƒÅmbhari chhe sƒÅri re.', '2. One who has renounced to worship God but does not actually worship God and yet yearns for sensual pleasures and makes an effort to acquiring these pleasures, then he is ruining his own liberation and the liberation of others, just as a mad man in a boat will cause the boat to tip over, drowning himself and others.', 'This body is a pile of dust. As long as it is well, worship and singing of devotional songs are possible. So, one should proceed slowly on this path. For example, if the king‚Äôs son is fed a lot in one day, he does not grow overnight, but if he is fed daily according to his needs, he grows gradually. Similarly, spiritual knowledge is attained slowly, through association. And without the association of appropriate people, meals are not prepared. Similarly, without the association of the God-realized Sadhu, God cannot be worshipped. So, whoever listens to these spiritual talks progresses. But overeating makes one feel more sleepy. And have we come together to merely eat and sleep? So, either today or tomorrow, in a month or six months, there is no alternative but to associate with the great Sadhu.', '‚ÄúBy spiritual wisdom, one should realize that I am not this inanimate, painful and perishable body. I am sachchidƒÅnand, ƒÅtmƒÅnand and akhandƒÅnand.‚Äù Swami said this and then said, ‚ÄúDo not merge with rajogun, tamogun, but become nirgun.‚Äù On this, he recited the shlok, ‚ÄòParinishthitopi nairgunye uttamashlokalilayƒÅ‚Äô1 and said, ‚ÄúOne habitually talks (about ƒÅtmƒÅ), but when contact is made (with worldly objects) then one argues for a seat or food.

Do not think that if a certain thing (like becoming rich) happens it will be good. Earn as much money as you need, but if a lot is attained, then there is no happiness in that. There were four people who prayed daily, ‚ÄúLet us have wealth, let us have wealth.‚Äù Then a voice from the heavens said, ‚ÄúBrothers, if you get wealth, then you will get a lot of misery.‚Äù They said, ‚ÄúLet all the miseries of the universe befall us, but give us wealth.‚Äù The voice from above replied, ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù Then they found four kilos of gold on the road, and they split into groups of two. Each group thought that if the other two were killed, they would get two kilos each. One group of two was sent to the town and told, ‚ÄúGo, prepare and bring some lƒÅddus so that we can eat.‚Äù The remaining pair thought, ‚ÄúWe will send those two to the well to fetch water and stone them to death.‚Äù The two who had gone to get the lƒÅddus also united, thinking, ‚ÄúIf we feed the other two poisoned lƒÅddus and kill them, then we will get two kilos of gold each.‚Äù So they had ghee-soaked lƒÅddus containing poison made (for the other group), and for themselves, they had simple ones made and brought them. Then the others said, ‚ÄúFetch some water from the well and then we will eat.‚Äù So these two went to the well to fetch water and they were stoned and killed. Then the remaining two sat to eat, and on inspecting the lƒÅddus, they saw two types. They said, ‚ÄúSee! They made good ones for themselves. Now we will eat them.‚Äù Then they ate the poisoned lƒÅddus and died. The gold remained untouched. See the happiness! This is what happens. Thus, that thing (wealth) is bad and wherever it goes, it causes disaster.', 'In Ahmedabad an 80-year-old merchant got a son and became mad (from happiness that he got a son).

In life, when one does business, there may be loss or there may be profit; marriage may occur and shrƒÅddh may also take place. All these should be thought of, but whatever happens, neither celebrate nor mourn. Since if one mourns, spiritual knowledge is lost and one falls back from satsang; the intellect becomes insensitive and ignorance increases.

Therefore, act separate to these three bodies and offer worship within the jiva, since by that, the causal body is destroyed.

So what if we are told that we do not know anything? If you are told that you know everything, then again, so what? Just by saying this knowledge will not be lost nor gained. We may do only a little, but do not be egoistic. Such conduct is like undertaking dhƒÅrnƒÅ-pƒÅrnƒÅ for a month and then eating three times a day without control. There is no value in that kind of behaviour. Eat in the same way throughout the year, otherwise to eat one morsel less is a pious austerity. And when one does dhƒÅrnƒÅ-pƒÅrnƒÅ for a month, if on the day of eating, even after eating to a full stomach, if one eats another eight morsels that is impious austerity.

The Brahmin stealthily came up behind her and pushed her in. Luckily, she caught hold of a branch on the side of the well and was saved from drowning. So the Brahmin picked up a big stone to throw at her. But, a snake suddenly appeared from below the stone and bit him. The Brahmin died.

Therefore, to practice renunciation is not easy, it is very difficult. If you want to go to Maharaj, then stay and observe the rules. One sadhu did not observe a fast for a bad dream, then Maharaj slapped him and said, ‚ÄúYou broke this rule so you have stepped on my tongue.‚Äù Then the Sadhu developed such a fever that he had to observe 30 fasts. And one person did not stay awake on night duty and the next night a scorpion stung him, so he had to stay awake the whole night.

Similarly, when I deliver these talks, the moss in the form of mƒÅyƒÅ is dispersed, and when the jiva rises to act, immediately, like the moss, the jiva merges (with mƒÅyƒÅ i.e. in activities). That is the nature of the jiva.', 'The same God who is seated resplendently in Akshardham comes here and sits in the same way. But if he displays human traits, then one‚Äôs perception changes. However, do not allow one‚Äôs perceptions to change. See, when Sundarji Suthar‚Äôs daughter grew up, he said to his brother, ‚ÄúShall we marry her to Maharaj?‚Äù Then (the brother) said, ‚ÄúDo not say that, do not say that.‚Äù Then Sundarji said, ‚ÄúWhy, is he not God compared to a carpenter?‚Äù Thus, there is a difference in the understanding of devotees. Otherwise, both Sundarji and his brother knew him as God. Even for us, if God marries someone‚Äôs sister or daughter, our firm faith that he is God does not remain. There are thousands of talks like this. How many shall I say? So if, when God displays human traits, equipoise remains and one feels, ‚ÄúOh! Great divinity has been displayed,‚Äù then one is truly convinced about God‚Äôs divine form. Even BrahmƒÅ became deluded when he saw Shri Krishna‚Äôs actions and said, ‚ÄúHe is not Parabrahman, but a cowherd.‚Äù And when Shri Krishna incarnated, BrahmƒÅ himself sang his praises, but seeing his actions, his resolute faith did not remain that way.', 'And another example: When that dispute occurred, Maharaj wore women‚Äôs clothes and fled from the darbƒÅr.

What is the reason for this type of liberation.‚Äù Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj said to the sadhus, ‚ÄúWhen a louse bears an offspring, it is as big as a nit. When an elephant bears an offspring, it is as big as a buffalo. Similarly, the cause of the avatƒÅrs that have occurred in the past and those that will occur in the future and the cause of the murtis residing in other abodes (i.e. Golok, Vaikunth, etc.) is us (me), the Purushottam NƒÅrƒÅyan, who is above all. Therefore, I grant ultimate liberation. If there is any untruth in this, then I swear by the paramhansas. If there is any misunderstanding in this truth, then one will not achieve the highest level of liberation. And after dying, one will not be able to correct their misunderstanding. Therefore, just as Vaikunth is for the residents of Vaikunth, Golok is for the residents of Golok, my abode is AkshardhƒÅm.  Whoever has developed the conviction of the manifest Purushottam that transcends Akshar but does not believe his ƒÅtmƒÅ to be the form of Akshar - which transcends Mul Purush, the cause of all - does not have the thorough conviction of the manifest Purushottam. Whereas, one who has developed the conviction characterized by understanding the greatness of the manifest Purushottam offers upƒÅsanƒÅ and bhakti to the manifest Purushottam - who transcends Akshar and is served by Mul Purush and infinite akshar-muktas; and he believes himself to be fulfilled from offering upƒÅsanƒÅ and bhakti. And only he has the conviction characterized by understanding of God‚Äôs greatness. This truth can only be understood by the association of an EkƒÅntik Bhakta of God; but it cannot be understood by one‚Äôs own intellect or by self-study of the scriptures.‚Äù This is how Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj spoke of his supremacy as Purushottam to the sadhus.', '1. At the time these words were spoken, Maharaj was sitting under the nimb (limdo) tree and sadhus and devotees were seated before Maharaj. Swami is referring to the sadhus and devotees as the ‚Äòpeople‚Äô because he considers only those who observe niyam-dharma and worship the manifest God as humans.', 'ParvatbhƒÅi of AgatrƒÅi was able to see Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj‚Äôs murti in all three states continuously. Yet, he wished: ‚ÄúWhat is the form of the other avatƒÅrs of God like?‚Äù With this one wish, the murtis of the 24 avatƒÅrs appeared and stood in front of ParvatbhƒÅi, and he had their darshan. Then, the 24 forms of the avatƒÅrs merged into Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj‚Äôs murti while they extolled MahƒÅrƒÅj‚Äôs greatness. This is how MahƒÅrƒÅj showed ParvatbhƒÅi his great powers.', 'When a wicked person beat a sadhu in AmdƒÅvƒÅd, MahƒÅrƒÅj was sitting near Lake KƒÅnkariyƒÅ. The sadhu arrived there. Seeing the sadhu, Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj said, ‚ÄúSomeone harmed my sadhu who is among the paramhansas that BrahmƒÅ, deities, and all the avatƒÅrs pray to and desire to have their darshan and who would not harm any jiva like an ant.‚Äù Then, MahƒÅrƒÅj sorrowfully sat facing south. BrahmƒÅ and others thought that all of the brahmƒÅnds will be destroyed. Suddenly, MahƒÅkƒÅl, Sankarshan, Shiv, and others came and prayed to MahƒÅrƒÅj, ‚ÄúO MahƒÅrƒÅj! We will immediately follow an order you give us. We are your servants. Who can harm your sadhu? We will destroy them in a second.‚Äù MahƒÅkƒÅl and others spoke this way.', 'Then, the sadhus, who possessed a divine vision, prayed to MahƒÅrƒÅj, ‚ÄúO MahƒÅrƒÅj! O SwƒÅmin! O Prabhu! You compassionately came here from AkshardhƒÅm to liberate countless jivas. Forgive the offenses of the jivas and liberate them.‚Äù The sadhus prayed to MahƒÅrƒÅj this way.', 'Then, MahƒÅrƒÅj spoke, ‚ÄúEverything in the infinite brahmƒÅnds happens according to my will. Just look, all of the avatƒÅrs merge into me. And I see this assembly of sadhus in AkshardhƒÅm. And whoever believes my talks is liberated, and those who do not go to narak. When I felt some illness in my body, many jivas were destroyed.1 And when I abstained from eating foods of six types of taste and refrained from wearing [rich] clothes and wore a rough cloth, no one had food to eat in the world or clothes to wear. They all suffered. Therefore, everything happens according to my will, but nothing happens according to someone else‚Äôs will. And, light greater than the light of millions of suns emanates from your body; and you are very powerful. KƒÅl, karma, and mƒÅyƒÅ have no authority over you. That is how I see you.‚Äù', 'The sadhus then said, ‚ÄúO MahƒÅrƒÅj! You are the avatƒÅri, the cause of the avatƒÅrs, and Purushottam, the sovereign of AkshardhƒÅm. What is surprising if you see that? You are eternally associated with the divine AkshardhƒÅm, the pƒÅrshads, virtues, and powers. You are eternal, inherently elevated, supreme, complete, limitless, and possess redemptive virtues. To bestow happiness to your ekƒÅntik devotees and to liberate countless jivas, you took birth in the home of HariprasƒÅd out of great compassion. And we also see you as we see a fruit in the palm of our hand. We acquired dharma and other qualities (i.e. dharma, gnƒÅn, vairƒÅgya, and bhakti), therefore, we are not impressed by anyone else. We will do as you wish and as you are pleased. We have nothing dear to us here or in the life hereafter. You are our life. To please you, we will take infinite births and shun the mƒÅyik happiness and base instincts. Therefore, O MahƒÅrƒÅj! Do not be sorrowful because of our pain. We are not pained. And the muktas of Vaikunth possess light that is a million times more luminous than the light of millions of suns. And the muktas of Golok possess light that is a million times more luminous than the muktas of Vaikunth. And the akshar-muktas possess light that is infinite times more luminous in one hair of their body. Even this much luminosity is eclipsed by the light in a span of land of AkshardhƒÅm equal to a betel-nut. And if one gathers all of the light of this AkshardhƒÅm, it does not equal to one strand of hair on the body of Harikrishna Purushottam, who is the cause of all avatƒÅrs. You possess a murti that is characterized by divine light, powers, strength, fame, self-luminosity, wishes that always bear fruit, and other such divine virtues. You compassionately appear as a human before us to liberate jivas.‚Äù This is how all the sadhus prayed before Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj.', '1. Maharaj shows the oneness between his body and the brahmƒÅnd. Parabrahma pervades everything and the infinite brahmƒÅnds are supported by him. Even while having assumed a human body, he shows this oneness. Therefore, whatever happens to his body is reflected in the brahmƒÅnd. When Maharaj fell ill, there was a famine in the world. Food was scarce. Many people, animals, birds and other jivas died from hunger or thirst, meaning they were not able to sustain their body. (This should not be interpreted literally, since the jiva cannot be destroyed.)', 'Once, in Akshar Ordi, Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj gave a command to VyƒÅpkƒÅnand SwƒÅmi, ‚ÄúGo to Indra-lok.‚Äù SwƒÅmi replied, ‚ÄúI have been there.‚Äù MahƒÅrƒÅj said, ‚ÄúGo to Golok and BrahmadhƒÅm (i.e. the abode of BrahmƒÅ).‚Äù SwƒÅmi replied, ‚ÄúI have been there.‚Äù MahƒÅrƒÅj commanded again, ‚ÄúGo to BhumƒÅ-Purush (i.e. VairƒÅj-Purush or VairƒÅt-Purush).‚Äù VyƒÅpkƒÅnand SwƒÅmi replied, ‚ÄúA demon with 1,000 heads is blocking the path.‚Äù MahƒÅrƒÅj said, ‚ÄúTake the same form as the demon and defeat him.‚Äù Then, VyƒÅpkƒÅnand SwƒÅmi did as told and said, ‚ÄúNow, there is a demon with 10,000 heads.‚Äù MahƒÅrƒÅj said, ‚ÄúAssume a form like his again and defeat him.‚Äù VyƒÅpkƒÅnand Swami did as told and reached BhumƒÅ-Purush. Seeing VyƒÅpkƒÅnand SwƒÅmi, BhumƒÅ-Purush said, ‚ÄúHas Purushottam manifested on the earth?‚Äù SwƒÅmi replied, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Pleased upon hearing this, BhumƒÅ-Purush was overjoyed and had VyƒÅpkƒÅnand SwƒÅmi sit on his throne. He performed SwƒÅmi‚Äôs ƒÅrti and pujan with fragrant flowers and chandan. Then, he asked of Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj‚Äôs news and said, ‚ÄúShriji MahƒÅrƒÅj had told me in the beginning that when I grace this brahmƒÅnd, I will send my sadhu to you. He has fulfilled that promise.‚Äù Then, both mutually spoke of Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj‚Äôs greatness.

Hearing this, Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj thought and decided, ‚ÄúWhen a new king ascends the throne, he releases all the prisoners. Similarly, I want to liberate countless jivas.‚Äù With this wish, he ordered SwarupƒÅnand Swami, ‚ÄúGo to the pits of narak, grant all the jivas a chaturbhuj form (i.e. possessing four arms), and send them to the abode of BhumƒÅ-Purush.‚Äù SwarupƒÅnand Swami did as ordered and returned.', 'Then, MahƒÅrƒÅj addressed the sadhus, ‚ÄúO sadhus!

Therefore, I elevated them with a form like Akshar. To those who believed me as equal to the past avatƒÅrs, I granted them that much powers and they reside in those abodes believing me to be the Lord of those abodes. Even if I go and tell them myself (that I am distinct and superior to them), they would not believe me; that is their firm conviction.‚Äù', 'Then, Maharaj awakened the devotee from his samƒÅdhi and told him, ‚ÄúTell everyone here what you saw.‚Äù The devotee narrated his experience to all the satsangis present. The paramhansas said, ‚ÄúKindly tell us so that we can develop the supreme conviction of your form.‚Äù', 'Shriji Maharaj said, ‚ÄúThis manifest Purushottam Bhagwan, who is transcendental to Akshar and who is served by infinite akshar-muktas, always resides in Akshardham. During the period of creation, he looked upon Akshar. Akshar looked upon the infinite akshar-muktas. One Purush1 stood up among the akshar-muktas. That Purush looked upon mƒÅyƒÅ. Then, infinite Pradhan-Purushes evolved from mƒÅyƒÅ. That Akshar-Purush enters the Pradhan-Purushes by assuming as many forms and protects them. While being served by infinite pƒÅrshads, powers, and wonders in his abode, he also serves Purushottam in an another form [in Akshardham]. In this way, he possesses many abilities. Even the great poets cannot fathom this Maha-Purush. Those with a contemporary understanding can only see as far as this Maha-Purush. And you all have attained the manifest Purushottam, who is served by infinite akshar-muktas [like the Maha-Purush]. This manifest Purushottam is the cause of all the murtis that reside in other abodes and all the avatƒÅrs and is the master of infinite muktas. He is complete with limitless, supreme, and unharnessable powers. Only those who attain the upƒÅsanƒÅ of this manifest Purushottam as you have attained attain Purushottam. Whereas, others may endeavor in millions of other spiritual means but do not attain Purushottam. What is the difference between the manifest Purushottam - who transcends Akshar and who is unequaled - and other deities and avatƒÅrs? It is like the difference between an arrow and one who shoots the arrow. And it is like the supreme emperor and vassal kings. And it is like the sun and other heavenly bodies. And it is like the moon and the stars.2 Such is the difference between the manifest Purushottam and the other avatƒÅrs, such as Ram, Krishna, etc. One should understand the manifest Purushottam as described. This is the main principle and essence of all the satpurushes and all the scriptures. And what needs to be done is to develop a firm upƒÅsanƒÅ of the manifest Harikrishna Purushottam. And the limitless Akshardham, infinite akshar-muktas, infinite and divine prosperity of Akshardham, infinite deities, and infinite Pradhan-Purushes are all the body (sharir) of Purushottam. If their greatness cannot be fathomed, then how can the manifest Purushottam - who is their shariri,3 who pervades all despite residing in one place, who is without blemishes and faults - be fathomed? He is infinitely limitless. And just has we (I) sit here as the manifest murti, I also reside in Akshardham; and I also see you sitting in Akshardham, and those who can experience samƒÅdhi also see this. However, this truth is not completely believed by you all. Only when you completely understand this will you not have to put forth effort in defeating the panch-vishays, lust, anger, etc. You will easily conquer them. And this assembly is rare even for BrahmƒÅ and other deities. I understand this assembly of satsangis to be greater than Golok, Vaikunth, Shvetdwip, and Badrikashram. And I see all of the devotees as extremely luminous. If there is any untruth in this, then I swear by this assembly of sadhus. We have to swear because not everyone understands completely the divinity.‚Äù In this way, Shriji Maharaj spoke about his supremacy as Purushottam to the senior ekƒÅntik sadhus who were sitting in front of him.', '1. This akshar-mukta, who is referred to as Purush, is a liberated jiva and also goes by the name of Maha-Purush, Prakruti-Purush, Mul-Purush, or Akshar-Purush.', '2. With the first analogy of an arrow and one who shoots the arrow, Maharaj explains that he is distinct from the avatƒÅrs, just as the arrow and one who shoots the arrow are distinct. Moreover, he is the cause of the avatƒÅrs, just as one who shoots the arrow is the cause of the arrow being shot. With the second analogy (an emperor and vassal kings), Maharaj states that, not only is he and the avatƒÅrs distinct, he is also superior, just as vassal kings serve the emperor and gain their powers from the emperor. The third analogy is that the sun is brighter than other heavenly bodies. During the night, only the light of the moon helps one see in the darkness, whereas, the light of countless stars cannot help one see.', '3. Shariri is one who dwells in the sharir - the body. The physical body is the sharir and the ƒÅtmƒÅ is the shariri. However, when speaking in terms of God, he is the shariri of even the ƒÅtmƒÅ and Aksharbrahman. Maharaj has mentioned this in Vachanamrut Gadhada I-64.', 'In the palace of Jetalpur, Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj asked MuktƒÅnand SwƒÅmi and other paramhansas, ‚ÄúWhichever abode I go to, they all praise you. Whichever scripture I read, they also contain your praises. What greatness do you possess that you are praised everywhere?‚Äù Then, Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj asked, ‚ÄúIf a gourd breaks, do you know how to mend it?‚Äù MuktƒÅnand SwƒÅmi replied, ‚ÄúNo, MahƒÅrƒÅj.‚Äù MahƒÅrƒÅj said, ‚ÄúYou do not know your own greatness. Allow me to describe your greatness. This earth measures 500 million yojans.1 Water is ten times greater than that. Light is ten times greater than water. Air is ten times greater than light. Space is ten times greater than air. AhamkƒÅr is ten times greater than space. Mahatattva is ten times greater than ahamkƒÅr. Prakruti and Purush are infinitely greater than mahatattva. And AkshardhƒÅm is infinitely greater than Prakruti-Purush. From that AkshardhƒÅm, if one releases a metal ball weighing 2 million kilograms, then it it will wear down to the size of a grain of sand from air friction. That is how far AkshardhƒÅm is. Yet, if you wish for an insignificant jiva to reach AkshardhƒÅm - which is beyond the eight barriers [of the brahmƒÅnd], then the jiva will reach it immediately. That is the power of your wish. Just as one flings a rock using a sling, you have the strength in your hand to fling a jiva to AkshardhƒÅm, and nothing in between, not even kƒÅl, mƒÅyƒÅ, etc., can intervene. But you do not know your own greatness. ', '‚ÄúMoreover, whoever feeds sadhus like you with love will receive the merits of millions of yagnas and will be liberated. And whoever touches your feet will have their sins of millions of births destroyed. And whoever offers clothes to you with love will attain the highest liberation. And whichever river, lake, or well you bathe in becomes a holy place of pilgrimage. And whichever tree you sit under or eat the fruit of also benefits. And whoever has your darshan  or bows to you with love will have all of their sins destroyed. Moreover, everyone you speak to about God or instruct to follow niyams will also attain liberation. Many such activities of yours are nirgun and for the liberation of the jivas.', '‚ÄúWhat is the reason for your greatness? It is because you all have attained the manifest Purushottam Bhagwan, the Lord of AkshardhƒÅm - which is above all. And you have the refuge of Purushottam and he has come here and is sitting in this assembly and he is bestowing bliss of his manifest murti. You have nothing remaining to do. And just as the muktas of AkshardhƒÅm have attained the bliss of Purushottam Bhagwan, you have attained the same bliss of the manifest Purushottam. Your greatest is due to the association with Purushottam. And everything happens in the infinite brahmƒÅnds according to my will; and by my grace, whatever you wish also happens in the infinite brahmƒÅnds. However, you do not know this. Why have I kept you powerless so? So that you can derive the bliss of the manifest form of God, I have restrained your powers. If I show you your powers, then you would not be considerate to anyone in this world, which would bar jivas from attaining liberation. Therefore, fearlessly contemplate on the manifest Purushottam but do not become miserable upon encountering the miseries of this word.‚Äù', '1.

How can we become such satsangis?‚Äù Then MahƒÅrƒÅj replied, ‚ÄúYou can become such satsangis by overcoming all material qualities, believing one‚Äôs ƒÅtmƒÅ as aksharrup and continuously remembering my murti. Then you can become such satsangis.‚Äù Then BrahmƒÅnand SwƒÅmi asked, ‚ÄúOnly with your grace can we become such satsangis.‚Äù Then Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj said, ‚ÄúJust see. This brahmƒÅnd is the size of an atom compared to Akshar; therefore, it is insignificant compared to Akshar. There are infinite such brahmƒÅnds that float in one pore of Akshar - that is the greatness of Akshar. And I am even greater than Akshar. Such as I am, I have come from that AkshardhƒÅm, and I did not stay in the realm of Prakruti-Purush or PradhƒÅn-Purush, and I did not stay in the countless other abodes and places. So then, how can the jivas in this brahmƒÅnd compare to my greatness? They are insignificant. Such as I am, I compassionately came to stay with you, speak to you, develop friendship with you, give you darshan daily, feed you, call you by name, and show love toward you in many other ways. Moreover, we tolerate your misbehavior just as one‚Äôs family member would. And you still say you want grace? How much more grace can we show?‚Äù', 'BrahmƒÅnand SwƒÅmi answered, ‚ÄúO MahƒÅrƒÅj! You have shown immense grace, but we have the barrier of mƒÅyƒÅ; therefore, we do not understand.‚Äù Then, Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj stood up and took off his upper garment and said, ‚ÄúIs there any barrier of mƒÅyƒÅ now? Do darshan.‚Äù2 SwƒÅmi said, ‚ÄúWe never understood grace in this manner.‚Äù MahƒÅrƒÅj spoke of his greatness for a long time in this manner.', '1. Here, gun-buddhi means possessing the qualities of the three gunas of mƒÅyƒÅ, implying that he has not become ekƒÅntik yet.', '2. Maharaj removing his upper garment is his lila-charitra. The purport of his words are to explain that to liberate jivas, he has done everything on his part (meaning he did not leave anything out). He even removed an insignificant barrier of a garment between himself and the jivas. Therefore, whatever needs to be done is on the part of the jivas. The subtle message is to believe one‚Äôs true form is Akshar and contemplate on the form of Purushottam.', 'In VartƒÅl, Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj was seated under a mango tree with his paramhansas. The paramhansas were engrossed in the darshan of MahƒÅrƒÅj‚Äôs lotus feet like a chakor bird.1 Then, four pƒÅtidƒÅrs came near MahƒÅrƒÅj and MahƒÅrƒÅj extended his feet. Seeing MahƒÅrƒÅj‚Äôs feet, they said, ‚ÄúMahƒÅrƒÅj! When we look at your holy feet, you appear to be Purushottam Bhagwan; but when we look at your body, you appear to be a human. We have seen many assemblies in many places, but never have we seen an assembly like this where everyone is absorbed in looking at you with a fixed gaze. Please tell us how we can understand this.‚Äù', 'Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj said, ‚ÄúVairƒÅt BrahmƒÅ (VirƒÅt-Purush) extolled the greatness of God for a period of his 50 years and 4.5 hrs so that these holy feet would grace this earth. After such effort, these holy feet have come to this earth. So understand how you want to understand. Furthermore, I am the sun in the form of a Sadguru and I have manifested from AkshardhƒÅm; while these sadhus are sunflowers who have blossomed.

Moreover, when all of the jivas of this brahmƒÅnd worship the name ‚ÄòSwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan, SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan‚Äô, then know satsang has grown.‚Äù', 'MahƒÅrƒÅj continued, ‚ÄúI want to redeem as many jivas as can fit in one billion ships. For that purpose, I came from AkshardhƒÅm along with my pƒÅrshads. But how can all of these jivas be liberated? I thought: may those who have my darshan be liberated. Then, I thought: how many jivas will have my darshan? Therefore, may those who have the darshan of my sadhus or consider their virtue be liberated.

And if there is still space, then we will fill the ships with mud. I want to completely fill the ships this way. These are the infinite distinctions of the muktas.1 Therefore, I want to grant the jivas the type of liberation as according to the degree of their association with God.‚Äù MahƒÅrƒÅj spoke of his greatness in this manner.', '1.

He addressed MuktƒÅnand SwƒÅmi and other paramhansas, ‚ÄúOur paramhansas and satsangis should develop the conviction as follows: we want to join the ranks of the akshar-muktas and reside in AkshardhƒÅm in the continuous service of God; but in no way do we want to wish for the mundane mƒÅyik happiness or be lured by it. Such should be our firm conviction. We have attained the manifest Purushottam Bhagwan, the cause of the avatƒÅrs and the sovereign of AkshardhƒÅm. Therefore, we should continuously offer ekƒÅntik bhakti (characterized by dharma, gnƒÅn, and vairƒÅgya) to Purushottam Bhagwan.‚Äù', 'Then, MuktƒÅnand SwƒÅmi asked, ‚ÄúO Maharaj! What is that AkshardhƒÅm like?‚Äù', 'Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj answered, ‚ÄúThat adobe of God is eternal, imperishable, extraordinary, and sachchidƒÅnand.1 And there is no place in the infinite brahmƒÅnds that can equal God‚Äôs abode. Moreover, there are many places, such as the locations of Indra, Varun, Kuber, Shiv, BrahmƒÅ, VairƒÅt, PradhƒÅn-Purush, Prakruti-Purush, etc.; but none compare to God‚Äôs AkshardhƒÅm. And the bliss that God‚Äôs devotees experience in AkshardhƒÅm cannot be equaled by the bliss others experience in the infinite brahmƒÅnds. And no other form in the infinite brahmƒÅnds can compare to the form of God. The reason is that all of the forms that evolved from Prakruti-Purush are all mƒÅyik, whereas God is amƒÅyik. And he eternally resides in his divine AkshardhƒÅm. Let me explain with an example. If this whole earth, including the mountains, trees, animals, birds, people, etc., were all made of glass, and all the stars in the sky were suns, then all of the forms on the earth would appear luminous from the light of the suns - that is the brilliance of AkshardhƒÅm. God‚Äôs devotees can see this AkshardhƒÅm in samƒÅdhi; and God‚Äôs murti is always seated in AkshardhƒÅm. When the devotees have the darshan of that murti during samƒÅdhi, the bliss of that darshan seems as if they experienced it for a thousand years. That bliss associated with God‚Äôs form during samƒÅdhi is abundant; and one would reject the happiness associated with the vishays in the infinite brahmƒÅnds in favor of the darshan of God‚Äôs murti experienced in one blink. Moreover, the bliss in one pore of God cannot be equaled by the happiness of the vishays gathered from the infinite brahmƒÅnds. That is the continuous bliss a God‚Äôs devotee experiences from God‚Äôs murti in AkshardhƒÅm. That Purushottam‚Äôs light emanating from one pore of his form can eclipse the infinite light of AkshardhƒÅm, which is beyond the eight barriers. O paramhansas! You have attained that manifest Purushottam, who possesses a form. When you leave your body, I will take you to that AkshardhƒÅm using my strength, but you cannot attain that adobe using the strength of your endeavors.', '‚ÄúFurthermore, what is the form of body of the muktas that reside in that AkshardhƒÅm like? Their form is different from the male and female forms in this brahmƒÅnd; and their form is neither like that of a female nor a male. Their form is devoid of the qualities of male and female and their body is characterized as brahma. Those muktas offer upƒÅsanƒÅ to the two holy feet of Purushottam and are engrossed in Purushottam; whereas, in other abodes, they offer upƒÅsanƒÅ to four feet. Specifically, the females [in other abodes] have a union with their husband and also with the murti of Purushottam (i.e., the presiding deity of that abode). And the males [in other abodes] readily serve the feet of their wife and also serve Purushottam (i.e., the presiding deity of that abode) with the nine types of bhakti. This type of upƒÅsanƒÅ and bhakti are not found in AkshardhƒÅm; this is found in other abodes. And that AkshardhƒÅm is mine.‚Äù', 'Then, the paramhansas asked, ‚ÄúO MahƒÅrƒÅj! What type of devotee reaches which abode?‚Äù', 'Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj answered, ‚ÄúThe ekƒÅntik bhaktas who identify their ƒÅtmƒÅ as Brahman and continuously contemplate on the murti of Purushottam become aksharrup and remain in the service of Purushottam NƒÅrƒÅyan. What type of bliss does God give those devotees? Well, he gives the same bliss to his devotees that his murti possesses. Therefore, those who have the true and complete upƒÅsanƒÅ and ekƒÅntik dharma reach Akshar (i.e., become aksharrup and attain AkshardhƒÅm). Those who have a deficiency in upƒÅsanƒÅ or in becoming free of desires reach Golok. One who has intense desires reaches the abodes of PradhƒÅn-Purush or VairƒÅt. If one has deficiency in upƒÅsanƒÅ and ekƒÅntik dharma, they become like BrahmƒÅ. Those who merely consider the virtues of satsang and serve sadhus in some way become like Indra. Those who serve to a lesser degree become devtƒÅs. One who simply considers the virtue of a sadhu will be freed from the misery of Jampuri. Such is the great distinction in attainment due to the difference in understanding.‚Äù In this way, Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj talked to the paramhansas about his supremacy as Purushottam.', '1.

Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj showed them their supreme powers. Then, the paramhansas each spoke in turn. Some said, ‚ÄúO MahƒÅrƒÅj! Shall I take this assembly to AkshardhƒÅm?‚Äù One said, ‚ÄúO MahƒÅrƒÅj! I see the workings of one brahmƒÅnd in the palm of my hand.‚Äù VyƒÅpkƒÅnand Swami spoke up, ‚ÄúYou see the workings of one brahmƒÅnd, but I see the infinite ishwars of infinite brahmƒÅnds - each of which are a wonder, and I see Golok and Vaikunth in the palm of my hand. The reason is the grace of Shri SahajƒÅnand SwƒÅmi, the manifest Purushottam, who is the cause of the avatƒÅrs, such as RƒÅm, Krishna, etc.‚Äù', 'Then, SwarupƒÅnand SwƒÅmi spoke, ‚ÄúBecause of his compassion, the sovereign of AkshardhƒÅm - Purushottam Bhagwan - has come to grant ultimate liberation and brought his full powers, his pƒÅrshads, his AkshardhƒÅm, MahƒÅ-Purush1 and other ishwars, and the presiding deities of Golok, Vaikunth, and other abodes.

And that very NarnƒÅrƒÅyandev in BadrikƒÅshram, LakshminƒÅrƒÅyandev in Vaikunth, and others offer upƒÅsanƒÅ to this manifest Purushottam who possesses two arms.‚Äù In this way, MahƒÅrƒÅj revealed that he is Purushottam. Hearing this, the wise ekƒÅntik sadhus understood that this manifest Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj is Purushottam, the cause of the avatƒÅrs and the master of AkshardhƒÅm. This is the conviction they solidified regarding Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj‚Äôs murti.', 'Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj spoke of his greatness of being Purushottam to the paramhansas in VartƒÅl for five to six days. Then, Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj said, ‚ÄúNityƒÅnand SwƒÅmi understands the significance of my talks.‚Äù The sadhus asked, ‚ÄúMahƒÅrƒÅj!

So how can others be called Purushottam? Therefore, when hearing such words, one should not allow doubts to form. We are (I am) that Purushottam, the manifest Harikrishna, who is the cause of the avatƒÅrs such as RƒÅm, Krishna, and others.

Similar words of Shriji Maharaj have been captured in Vachanamrut Loya 13: ‚ÄúOf course, by considering their association with God, it is acceptable to endow greatness upon anyone. BrahmƒÅ, Shiv, NƒÅrad, the SanakƒÅdik and Uddhav can all be called God because of their association with God. At present, even a sƒÅdhu like MuktƒÅnand SwƒÅmi can be considered to be like God because of his association with God.

The sadhus debated for seven to eight days. Some sadhus opined, ‚ÄúMahƒÅrƒÅj should be referred to as Shri Krishna.‚Äù NityƒÅnand SwƒÅmi, on the other hand, said, ‚ÄúHow can MahƒÅrƒÅj be referred to as other (avatƒÅrs)? Did the other avatƒÅrs merge the 24 avatƒÅrs, BhumƒÅ-Purush, and other infinite [ishwars] in their form? Did any avatƒÅr show everyone the other avatƒÅrs performing their own pujan? On the other hand, Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj actually showed VyƒÅpkƒÅnand SwƒÅmi the 24 avatƒÅrs merge into himself in order to solidify his conviction. And he showed ParvatbhƒÅi the 24 avatƒÅrs merge into him while he was tilling his farm. Furthermore, many people - who worshiped other avatƒÅrs -  of MƒÅngrol and other villages that MahƒÅrƒÅj visited came for his darshan. He sat all of them in meditation and showed them their ishtadev. Each of their isthadev told their devotees, ‚ÄòThis SahajƒÅnand SwƒÅmi is the avatƒÅri, the cause of all the avatƒÅrs. He is Purna Purushottam and we are his servants.‚Äô He showed infinite powers and other wondrous miracles. Shri SahajƒÅnand SwƒÅmi is transcendental to Akshar and the cause of RƒÅm, Krishna, and other avatƒÅrs. How can he be equaled to the other avatƒÅrs?

This murti is supreme; therefore, he grants them the supreme (ultimate) liberation. And Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj has never come to this brahmƒÅnd before and will never come again.1 There is only one like him. I travel to Vaikunth, BadrikƒÅshram, Shvetdwip, and other abodes.

The purport of this statement by Shriji Maharaj is that he came on this earth for the first time and he will remain present through the Satpurush who is Aksharbrahma. If Maharaj remains present on this earth through the Satpurush, then there is no question of him having to come again. Therefore, Maharaj says he will never come again.', '2. The four emanations of God (chaturvyuh): The four emanations of God are the four forms of Vishnu that play different roles in the workings of the brahmƒÅnd. VƒÅsudev is the form of Vishnu that is meant for worship. The work of Pradyumna is to propagate dharma and to cause the creation the brahmƒÅnd. The work of Aniruddha is to explain the tattvas - i.e., elements - and to cause the sustenance of creation. The work of Sankarshan is to propagate spiritual knowledge and to cause the destruction of creation.', '3. The 24 forms [of Vishnu]: The 24 forms of Vishnu are the 24 unique names given to Vishnu based on the permutations of the four objects he holds in his four hands. For example, in the form of Keshav, he holds the lotus in his lower right hand, the conch in his upper right hand, the Sudarshan Chakra in his upper left hand and the mace in his lower left hand. In the form of NƒÅrƒÅyan, he holds the conch in his lower right hand, the lotus in his upper right hand, the mace in his upper left hand and the Sudarshan Chakra in his lower left hand.', 'Based on these permutations, the names of the 24 forms of Vishnu are as follows: Keshav, NƒÅrƒÅyan, MƒÅdhav, Govind, Vishnu, Madhusudan, Trivikram, VƒÅman, Shridhar, Hrushikesh, PadmanƒÅbh, DƒÅmodar, Sankarshan, VƒÅsudev, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Purushottam, Adhokshaj, Nrusinh, Achyut, JanƒÅrdan, Upendra, Hari and Krishna.', 'Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj revealed his personal principle to the sadhus, ‚ÄúThe muktas of Vaikunth possess luminosity that is millions of times greater than millions of suns. A million times greater than that is the luminosity of the muktas of Golok. Infinitely greater than that is the luminosity of one pore of the muktas of AkshardhƒÅm. And infinitely greater luminosity is eclipsed by the light of AkshardhƒÅm contained is a span of land equal to a betel-nut. If one gathers the limitless light of AksahrdhƒÅm, it would still not equal a millionth of one pore of Harikrishna Purna Purushottam, who is the cause of all avatƒÅrs. He possesses a divine murti characterized by light, powers, strength, fame, and other divine virtues. He is self-luminous and satya-sankalp (whatever he wishes comes true). He possesses powers, such as power to do, power to know, power to act, power to eclipse, power to support, power to inspire, power that is eternal, power to captivate all, power to escape the contemplation of all, power that cannot be harnessed by anyone, power to become undistinguished despite being distinguished, power to be free of flaws, power to be unconquerable, power to be handsome, power to be the controller of all (i.e., the other entities - jivas, ishwars, mƒÅyƒÅ, and Brahman), power to be beautiful, and other infinite divine powers and other great wondrous virtues. With these powers, Shri Harikrishna Purushottam SahajƒÅnand SwƒÅmi eternally resides in his AkshardhƒÅm in a divine form. Though he takes birth, he has no birth. He is indivisible and his murti is completely whole. While possessing a human-like form, he possesses a divine form. While possessing a divine form, he possesses a human-like form. While he is here, he is also in AkshardhƒÅm. While being in AkshardhƒÅm, he is also here. Wherever he is, that is the center of AkshardhƒÅm. And SahajƒÅnand SwƒÅmi is Purushottam who possesses beauty, solemnity, sweetness, motherly love, discipline, wisdom, strength, brilliance, emotion, smell, and other wondrous qualities. He is seated in AkshardhƒÅm where he is served by infinite muktas and infinite powers. He is inherently blissful of his own bliss. He compassionately accepts the service of Akshar and others. He himself is completely free of flaws and completely fulfilled. He is served by Akshar and the infinite muktas, infinite powers, infinite personalities, and infinite wonders. He is eternally enlightened. His powers are extremely limitless and uncontrollable (by anyone). With these powers, Shri SwƒÅminƒÅrƒÅyan Purushottam - transcendental to Akshar -  was born to Dharmadev and BhaktimƒÅtƒÅ. All of the avatƒÅrs appear from him and then merge into him. Therefore, one should adopt a method with a calm mind so that one understands faith, gnƒÅn, greatness, trust, love, refuge, and anuvrutti exceedingly day by day, and one should keep the type of company and read the type of scriptures which foster this.‚Äù I have spoken the personal principle of the great sadhus1 and Shriji MahƒÅrƒÅj thus.', '1. The great sadhus (MotƒÅ Sant) refers to Aksharbrahman Satpurush and others who have achieved the state of enlightenment through his association.', 'SahajƒÅnandji MahƒÅrƒÅj, the manifest Purushottam who transcends Akshar, is worthy of upƒÅsanƒÅ by all.

NƒÅmnƒÅ nƒÅmi - literally name of the name - can be explained with an example: the flower is the name and its fragrance is the nƒÅmi. Calling a flower by any other name does not change the fact that the flower provides fragrance. Hence, the nƒÅmi, who is God, endows the object its quality.

Just as a lustful person, thief, illusionist, addict, and one with a malicious intent eagerly endeavor in their objective;1 similarly, a muni also endeavors in beholding the murti of Shri Hari with an enthusiastic mind. Just as a faithful wife, chakor,2 moth, fish, chakvƒÅ, chakvi,3 and bapaiyƒÅ4 are all engrossed in the object of their  passion;5 similarly, a yogi remains engrossed in the murti of Shri Hari with intense joy.

And if the happiness of infinite brahmƒÅnds was gathered, it will not equal a millionth fraction of the bliss gained from the meditation or darshan of Shri Hari done in a blink of an eye. The essence of all the sadhus, satsangis, Akshar, etc., is the murti of Shri Hari. One who understands this with a theistic mind can meditate upon Shri Hari.

Only a gnƒÅni who understands this can meditate upon Shri Hari. And what is rare in this world and the world beyond? It is solidifying the knowledge of Shri Hari‚Äôs form, upƒÅsanƒÅ, refuge, faith, anuvrutti, and love. And this is the essence of the essence. MuktƒÅnand SwƒÅmi, GopƒÅlƒÅnand SwƒÅmi, NityƒÅnand SwƒÅmi, BrahmƒÅnand SwƒÅmi, and countless other sadhus and satsangis achieved an elevated state by offering upƒÅsanƒÅ to Shri Hari. Moreover, during the period of creation, the BrahmƒÅ of each of the infinite brahmƒÅnds perform extreme austerities to please God and fulfill their wishes. One should understand Shri Hari‚Äôs human-like actions, divine actions, his nirgun and sagun forms,1 his sƒÅkƒÅr and nirƒÅkƒÅr forms,2 his power of doing and remaining aloof of doing,3 anvay and vyatirek forms,4 nature, qualities, and name thoroughly and understand his form through shravan, manan, nididhyƒÅs, and sƒÅkshƒÅtkƒÅr,5 and then seek his refuge. With these forms of austerities, one should please God.', '1. Sagun form of God refers God possessing divine redemptive virtues. It also refers to his vastness. Nirgun form of God refers to God being devoid of the qualities of mƒÅyƒÅ, namely the three gunas: sattva, raja, and tama. It also refers to God being extremely subtle, i.e., smaller than the smallest.', '2. In the sƒÅkƒÅr form, God always possesses a definite and divine human-like form in his abode Akshardham. This is referred to as his vyatirek form. In his anvay form, whilst being sƒÅkƒÅr in his vyatirek form, he pervades everything - this is his nirƒÅkƒÅr form. Nevertheless, one should not understand God being nirƒÅkƒÅr like space. Even in his anvay form, he still possesses the powers to control all, witness the activities of all, and bestow the fruits of the karmas of all.', '3. As the kartƒÅ, God is creator, destroyer, and the controller of the infinite brahmƒÅnds. Despite being the kartƒÅ, he remains aloof of his ‚Äòdoership‚Äô. Hence, he is the akartƒÅ.', '4. See footnote 3.', '5. The methods of shravan, manan, nididhyƒÅs, and sƒÅkshƒÅtkƒÅr,5 are explained in Vachanamrut Sarangpur 3.', 'One who accepts the authority of the scriptures is considered a man. If one gathers one thousand such men, one will find one who abides by dharma. If one gathers one thousand men who abide by dharma, one will find one who endeavors to achieve spiritual powers. If one gathers one thousand of them, one will find one who endeavors to reach God. If one gathers one thousand of them, one will find one who endeavors having recognized God. If one gathers one thousand of those who have recognized God, one will find a true gnƒÅni who understands God‚Äôs limitless form, swabhƒÅv, and powers thoroughly through his vastness of knowledge; however, he does not reach the limit [of understanding God‚Äôs greatness]. Because, God himself does not reach the limit of his form, swabhƒÅv, virtues, and powers; so how can others? All of the powers and murtis in the infinite brahmƒÅnds and AkshardhƒÅm and other abodes are dependent on the supreme Harikrishna Purushottam. [MahƒÅrƒÅj] showed that in samƒÅdhi and he gave people darshan in the form of their ishtadevs and solidified their conviction that he is supreme. And he shows other immeasurable and supreme divine powers, and he eclipses the powers of Akshar, etc., with his own powers, and he himself prevails as the supreme. Such is Harikrishna Purushottam, the master of BrahmadhƒÅm, whom Dharmadev and Marichi and other rishis pleased in VrundƒÅvan by performing a yagna and received the fulfillment of their mind‚Äôs wishes. A yogi should eagerly endeavor for the gnƒÅn and meditation of Shri Harikrishna‚Äôs murti. ', 'Harikrishna Purushottam is distinct from Akshar, self-luminous, the master of all, powerful with the powers of doer-ship, aloof of doer-ship, and doer-ship through others, an ocean of infinite divine redemptive virtues, and very attractive. He always possesses a definite form, is the inspirer [of all the entities to engage in their tasks], eternal, limitless, uncontrollable by anyone, endowed with splendor, an ocean of infinite bliss, the embodiment of great knowledge, and controller of all. His murti is unequaled, he is eternally imperishable, and his murti is characterized with knowledge, omniscience, and glory. He is the cause of countless entities and countless akshar-muktas, kƒÅl, mƒÅyƒÅ, Purush, and other forces; he is the support of the four emanations (Vasudev, etc.), the twenty-four murtis, such as Keshav, etc., and the avatƒÅrs, such as RƒÅm, Krishna, etc. He always possesses a divine form throughout the period of creation, sustenance, and dissolution. He is unconquerable. Though he is one, he has many forms and though he has many forms, he is one. He is superior to all. He is the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, Parmeshwar, extremely compassionate, Purushottam, fulfilled, transcendental, Parabrahman, unequalled in form, swabhƒÅv, qualities, and glory. And he is supreme. And the greatness of Harikrishna Purushottam is based on his gnƒÅn that transcends mƒÅyƒÅ, strength, luminosity, powers, etc. Who is capable of thoroughly explaining, understanding, seeing, hearing, or attaining his limitless greatness?
